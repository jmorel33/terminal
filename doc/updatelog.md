## [v2.7.20] - Clear Screen API & Console Commands
**Release Date:** 2026-06-06

### K-Term Library
- **`KTerm_ClearScreen(KTerm* term, bool clear_scrollback)`** — New public API function. When `clear_scrollback` is false, clears the visible viewport (CSI 2J equivalent). When true, voids the entire ring buffer (`memset` + ring state reset), equivalent to a fresh session.
- **CSI 3J hardened** — `ExecuteED` parameter 3 now properly voids the buffer: `memset` zero, resets `screen_head`, `history_rows_populated`, and `view_offset` (previously only iterated cells without resetting ring state).

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- **`cls`** — Voids entire buffer history via `\x1B[3J\x1B[2J\x1B[H` (scrollback destroyed, fresh slate).
- **`clear`** — Clears visible screen only via `\x1B[2J\x1B[H` (scrollback preserved, can scroll back up).
- **`term_size`** — New command; reports terminal grid dimensions (columns × rows) from the active session.
- **Tab completion** — added `term_size` to command list.
- **Help** — page 1 and page 2 updated with new commands.

## [v2.7.19] - Console Phase 4 Follow-ups
**Release Date:** 2026-06-06

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- **`mouse_on` / `mouse_off`** — toggle SGR mouse reporting from the built-in CLI.
- **Harness** — `sit_test.exe --module kterm_console` runs `KTERM_CAPTURE_*` screenshot smoke test.

---

## [v2.7.18] - KaOS Terminal Console Unification
**Release Date:** 2026-06-06

Merged legacy `examples/console.c` into `examples/kterm_console.c` and removed the duplicate example.

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- **Canonical console only** — deleted `examples/console.c`; CMake target is `kterm_console` (was `console_example`).
- **`ConsoleCopyString()`** — bounded copies in history/edit paths (ported from legacy console).
- **`sys_info` / `sysinfo`** — use split Situation device-info APIs instead of deprecated `SituationGetDeviceInfo()`; `sys_displays` uses `SituationFreeDisplays` + current monitor index.
- **Screenshot testing** — `KTERM_CAPTURE_SCREENSHOT` / `KTERM_CAPTURE_EXIT` env vars in main loop.
- **Tab completion** — command names + `font` argument names + `cd`/`type` path prefix (Windows).
- **`term_vtlevel`** — extended VT510–525, K95, Tera Term, PuTTY, ANSI.SYS labels.
- **Cleanup** — removed dead `ProcessConsolePipeline()` and stale `mouse_on/mouse_off` help.

### Docs
- `doc/COMPILATION_GUIDE.md` § KaOS Terminal Console (build + screenshot env vars).
- Redirected stale `console.c` references in K-Term plans and Situation release notes (historical example list only).

### Situation API Dependencies (v2.4.207)
- Consumer: `SituationGetCPUInfo()`, `SituationGetGPUInfo()`, `SituationGetMemoryInfo()`, storage/network/input enumeration, monitor queries.

## [v2.7.17] - Virtual Display Render Target Migration
**Release Date:** 2026-06-06

### Architecture
- **Render target abstraction** (`kt_render_sit.h`) — KTerm now renders into a Situation Virtual Display (compute-target VD) instead of a standalone texture. New adapter functions: `KTerm_CreateRenderTarget`, `KTerm_DestroyRenderTarget`, `KTerm_MarkRenderTargetDirty`. The host application owns the frame lifecycle and composites kterm as a layer via `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays()`.
- **Compositable terminal** — KTerm can now coexist alongside other Virtual Displays (3D scenes, overlays, other terminals) with proper z-ordering, blend modes, and scaling managed by Situation's compositor.
- **`KTERM_STANDALONE_MODE`** — Compile-time flag that restores the old direct-present behavior (kterm owns Acquire/Present/EndFrame). Useful for fullscreen-only terminal applications with zero compositing overhead.

### Changes
- `KTerm` struct gains `KTermRenderTarget render_target` field.
- `KTermCompositor_Render` no longer calls `AcquireFrameCommandBuffer`, `CmdPresent`, or `EndFrame` (VD mode). Frame lifecycle delegated to host.
- Init, resize, and shutdown paths use `KTerm_CreateRenderTarget` / `KTerm_DestroyRenderTarget` instead of raw `CreateTextureEx`.
- Render mode documentation added to `kterm_api.h` header.

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- Main loop restructured: host calls `SituationAcquireFrameCommandBuffer()` → `KTerm_Draw()` → `SituationRenderVirtualDisplays()` → `SituationEndFrame()`.
- `#ifdef KTERM_STANDALONE_MODE` guard for the simpler standalone loop path.

### Situation API Dependencies (v2.4.205)
- New: `SituationVDFlags` enum (`SITUATION_VD_FLAG_COMPUTE_TARGET`)
- New: `SituationCreateVirtualDisplayEx()` — creates VDs with extended flags; compute targets skip depth/render pass, add STORAGE usage
- New: `SituationGetVirtualDisplayTexture()` — returns a `SituationTexture` handle for the VD's internal texture
- `SituationVirtualDisplay` struct gains `flags` and `texture_slot_index` fields
- `SituationDestroyVirtualDisplay` now handles compute-target texture slot cleanup

## [v2.7.16] - ConPTY Resize, System Commands, Mouse & Scrollback Fixes
**Release Date:** 2026-06-04

### Enhancement
- **ConPTY size sync** (`kt_shell.h`) — `KTShell_Start` now accepts `cols, rows` parameters (passed to `CreatePseudoConsole` / `forkpty` with `winsize`). Added `KTShell_Resize()` — calls `ResizePseudoConsole` (Windows) or `ioctl TIOCSWINSZ` (POSIX). Shell processes now wrap at the correct column count after window resize.
- **Mouse mapping uses actual window ratio** (`kt_io_sit.h`) — Cell size calculated from `window_size / grid_size` instead of hardcoded `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SCALE`. Works correctly at any scale factor. Mouse cursor position (`cursor_x`/`cursor_y`) now updates every frame for live hover highlight.

### Bug Fixes
- **Cursor hidden during scrollback** (`kt_composite_sit.h`) — Text cursor no longer renders when `view_offset > 0`. Previously the cursor stayed visible at its grid coordinates while the viewport was scrolled back, making it appear you'd type at the wrong location.
- **Shell Enter key** — Sends only `\r` to ConPTY instead of `\r\n`. Fixes potential double-newline issues with some shell programs.

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- **New commands:** `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`/`dir`, `font [name]`, `sysinfo`, `ps`/`processes`, `threads`/`workers`.
- **`sysinfo`** — Box-drawn CP437 system snapshot: OS, versions, CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM, audio, displays, storage.
- **`ps`** — OS process list via `SituationGetProcessList()` (PID, memory, name).
- **`threads`** — Situation internal thread pool status (roles, CPU placement, job stats, audio state).
- **`font`** — Lists 18 built-in fonts or switches font by name (e.g. `font VGA`, `font NEC`).
- **Window title updates** — Title callback wired; updates on shell enter/exit and OSC 2 from child processes.
- **Any-event mouse tracking** — Mode 1003 + SGR 1006 enabled at startup; cell highlight follows mouse continuously.
- **OS cursor hide/show** — System cursor hidden when mouse is over the terminal window, restored on leave.
- **ConPTY resize on window resize** — Shell subprocess notified of new dimensions on every resize event.
- **Help page 3** — Filesystem, system introspection, and appearance commands.
- **Enhanced `demo` and `graphics`** — Full capability showcase: 256-color cube, truecolor gradients, CP437 block art, attribute combinations, box-drawing comparison.

## [v2.7.15] - 8×8 Native Cell Size, Shell ConPTY, IO Cleanup
**Release Date:** 2026-06-03

### Breaking Change
- **Cell size corrected to 8×8** — `DEFAULT_CHAR_WIDTH` and `DEFAULT_CHAR_HEIGHT` changed from 10 to 8, matching the built-in IBM 8×8 font. `term->char_width`/`char_height` now equal `font_data_width`/`font_data_height`. Applications relying on the old 10×10 padded cells will need to adjust window sizing or use `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SCALE`.

### Enhancement
- **Shell backend uses ConPTY** (`kt_shell.h`) — Windows implementation upgraded from plain pipes to `CreatePseudoConsole`. Shell processes (cmd.exe, powershell) now have full interactive echo, arrow keys, tab completion, and ANSI color support. Proper shutdown ordering prevents freeze on `exit`.
- **Removed debug fprintf from `kt_io_sit.h`** — The `[IO] CharPressed` log line that fired on every keystroke has been removed.

### Bug Fixes
- **Shell exit no longer freezes** — `KTShell_Stop` closes the PTY and read pipe before waiting on the reader thread. Uses 200ms timeout with graceful fallback instead of blocking indefinitely.
- **Console returns to built-in mode cleanly** — Resets `waiting_for_prompt_cursor_pos` on shell exit to unblock the DSR/prompt cycle.

## [v2.7.14] - Configurable Input Buffer, CP437 Charset, Shell Backend
**Release Date:** 2026-06-03

### Enhancement
- **Configurable input queue capacity** — Added `input_buffer_size` field to `KTermConfig`. Callers can now specify the input pipeline buffer size at creation time (e.g., 8 MB for shell-backed terminals piping large output). Default (0) retains the existing 1 MB (`KTERM_INPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE`) behavior.
- **CP437 character set support** — Added `CHARSET_CP437` to the `CharacterSet` enum. Populates the charset LUT so bytes 0x80-0xFF map to correct Unicode codepoints (box drawing, block elements, accented characters) via the GR charset path. ANSI art files now render correctly when piped through in ASCII mode.
- **Implemented `KTerm_SelectCharacterSet` / `KTerm_SetCharacterSet`** — These were declared in the API but never defined. Now functional for programmatic charset designation.
- **Shell process backend (`kt_shell.h`)** — New single-header cross-platform shell subprocess library. Spawns a shell (cmd.exe / /bin/sh) with redirected pipes, reader thread buffers output, non-blocking read API for integration with the frame loop. Supports Windows (CreateProcess), POSIX (forkpty), and Emscripten (stub for future virtual shell).

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- Added `type <filepath>` command — pipes raw file bytes into terminal (ANSI art support).
- Added `shell [cmd]` command — spawns a system shell subprocess; all I/O passes through kterm.
- Switched from UTF-8 mode to ASCII + CP437 on GR — retro DOS-style native byte rendering.
- Removed debug fprintf noise (CONSOLE_DEBUG default set to 0).
- Input buffer increased to 4 MB for file/shell piping.

## [v2.7.13] - API Alignment & Rendering Fixes
**Release Date:** 2026-06-02

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed white box rendering artifacts** — Default background cells were set to alpha=0 (transparent), allowing stale framebuffer content to bleed through. Default bg is now opaque black.
- **Fixed selection highlight persisting permanently** — `sel_active` push constant was never reset to 0 when no selection was active; any mouse click caused permanent color inversion. Added explicit `sel_active = 0` in the else branch.
- **Fixed mouse selection never clearing** — Clicking (without dragging) now clears the selection. Mouse selection logic disabled pending proper UX design.
- **Fixed box-drawing characters rendering as 'M'** — Console example wrote raw CP437 bytes which got mangled by the GR charset (DEC Special Graphics strips high bit). Switched console to UTF-8 mode (`ESC %G`) with proper UTF-8 encoded box-drawing characters.

### Test Harness Alignment
- **Fixed focused test compilation** — Added workspace root include path (`-I../../..`), backend defines (`-DSITUATION_USE_OPENGL`, `-DSITUATION_ENABLE_THREADING`), and harness stubs for `sit_test_stereo_scope.c` symbols.
- **Fixed `KTERM_FAILURE` constant** — Replaced dependency on removed `SITUATION_FAILURE` with `(-1)`.
- **Updated `mock_situation.h`** — Added `SituationAudioGraph`, `SituationNodeHandle`, `SituationAudioCaptureCallback`, PCM node mocks, texture readback types, and fixed callback signature to match current API.
- **Updated voice tests** — Fixed `mock_audio_cb` calls to new capture callback signature `(buffer, frame_count, user_data)`. Updated playback test for PCM node graph path.
- All 258 focused tests passing.

### Console Example (`kterm_console.c`)
- Terminal size set to 80×60 characters.
- Response callback now properly filters escape sequences while passing through control characters (Enter, Backspace, Tab, Ctrl+*).

## [v2.7.12] - Consolidated Security Verification
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release closes the rebased backlog audit by proving that the remaining historical security, networking, and performance reserve items were absorbed by earlier current-line patches.

### Consolidation
*   **Backlog Landing Map**: Marked the old `v2.7.5` through `v2.7.13` backlog as rebased and documented where each item landed in the current patch sequence.
*   **Reserve Slots**: Documented that current `v2.7.13`, `v2.7.14`, and `v2.7.15` are not needed for the supplied backlog because their intended spillover work landed in `v2.7.6`, `v2.7.7`, `v2.7.8`, `v2.7.9`, `v2.7.10`, and `v2.7.11`.
*   **Security Coverage**: Confirmed core bounds/null-termination coverage through oversized answerback, function-key/event, title, and shared SSH/Telnet client string helper tests.
*   **Client Audit**: Verified that `ssh_client.c` and `telnet_client.c` no longer contain `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcat`, `strncat`, or `sprintf` calls.

### Maintenance
*   Bumped library version to 2.7.12.

### Verification
*   **Focused Harness**: Default focused harness reports 258 total, 258 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
*   **Optional Networking**: `KTERM_OPTIONAL_NET=1` focused harness reports 270 total, 270 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
*   **Client Smoke Compile**: Object-only compile smoke checks for `ssh_client.c` and `telnet_client.c` both succeeded.

## [v2.7.11] - API Cleanup And Documentation Consistency
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release removes stale public references to polling-era keyboard/mouse APIs and aligns documentation with the current event-driven input model.

### Cleanup
*   **Public Header Cleanup**: Removed dead commented declarations for `KTerm_UpdateMouse`, `KTerm_UpdateKeyboard`, `UpdateKeyboard`, and `GetKeyEvent` from `kterm_api.h`.
*   **Implementation Comments**: Updated stale `KTerm_GetKey()` comments in `kterm_impl.h` to reference `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()`, `KTerm_ProcessEvent()`, and platform adapters instead of removed polling functions.
*   **Status Comments**: Replaced stale `vt_keyboard.buffer` references with `session->input.buffer` terminology.

### Documentation
*   **Technical Manual**: Updated `doc/kterm.md` to describe `KTermKeyEvent`, current `KTermEventType` values, `KTerm_ProcessEvent()`, `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()`, and `KTerm_GetKey()` accurately.
*   **README**: Replaced obsolete `VTKeyEvent`/`VTKeyboard` references with `KTermKeyEvent` and `KTermInputConfig`.
*   **Console Examples**: Removed stale diagnostic comments that referenced the removed `vt_keyboard` structure.

### Verification
*   **Grep Check**: Verified that `KTerm_UpdateMouse`, `KTerm_UpdateKeyboard`, `UpdateKeyboard`, `GetKeyEvent`, `VTKeyEvent`, `vt_keyboard`, and `KTERM_EVENT_KEYBOARD` no longer appear in `kterm_api.h`, `kterm_impl.h`, `doc/kterm.md`, `README.md`, or console examples.
*   **Historical Exceptions**: Remaining matches are limited to historical plan/changelog text and current Situation adapter names such as `KTermSit_UpdateKeyboard`.

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness**: Default focused harness remains at 258 passing tests across 18 modules.

### Maintenance
*   Bumped library version to 2.7.11.

## [v2.7.10] - Hot-Path String Performance
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release removes avoidable repeated string scans in Gateway, banner, SSH trigger listing, WHOIS, and network diagnostic output paths while preserving generated protocol output.

### Performance
*   **Gateway Font Listing**: Replaced `GET;FONTS` repeated `strcat`/`strlen` assembly with a moving write cursor and length-aware `memcpy`.
*   **Cached Font Name Lengths**: Added `name_len` to `KTermFontDef`, making font-list generation use O(1) name lengths instead of rescanning every font name.
*   **SSH Trigger Listing**: Reworked `ext;ssh;trigger;list` response assembly to maintain `cur_len` rather than recomputing `strlen(msg)` for each active trigger.
*   **Banner Gradient Emission**: Used `snprintf` return values and constant reset-sequence length instead of rescanning emitted color sequences.
*   **WHOIS Output Escaping**: Used the existing escaped-output cursor to truncate large WHOIS chunks instead of calling `strlen` on the full escaped buffer.
*   **PacketDiag Flag Listing**: Replaced repeated TCP flag `strcat` appends with bounded cursor-based formatting.

### Measured Delta
*   **GET;FONTS Assembly**: Removes one response-prefix `strlen`, one font-name `strlen`, and up to two `strcat` destination rescans per emitted font. With the current 18 builtin fonts, one full response avoids 19 explicit `strlen` calls and 35 `strcat` destination rescans.

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness Growth**: Expanded the default focused harness to 258 passing tests across 18 modules.
*   **Optional Networking Growth**: Optional networking builds now report 270 passing tests across 19 modules.
*   **Gateway Output Equivalence**: Added coverage proving optimized `GET;FONTS` still emits the expected builtin font list.
*   **WHOIS Output Equivalence**: Added networking-gated coverage proving optimized WHOIS escaping/truncation still replaces protocol-sensitive characters and keeps bounded output.

### Documentation
*   **Upgrade Plan**: Marked the `v2.7.10` hot-path string performance section complete in `kterm_2_7_6_upgrade_plan.md`.
*   **Harness And Bug Plans**: Updated default, optional networking, and Gateway test counts.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.10.

## [v2.7.9] - Gateway Grid FillSpan Correctness
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release fixes Gateway Grid horizontal fill spans that start outside the visible column range, especially wrapped spans whose initial `x` coordinate is greater than or equal to the terminal width.

### Fixes
*   **Wrapped FillSpan Coordinates**: Normalized wrapped horizontal `fill_span` starts with modulo/division arithmetic so `x >= cols` advances rows and preserves the correct wrapped column.
*   **Non-Wrapped FillSpan Bounds**: Added early no-op exits for non-wrapped spans whose computed horizontal range is fully outside the terminal.
*   **Out-Of-Bounds Safety**: Ensured wrapped spans that normalize beyond the last row exit without writes or looping.
*   **Code Cleanup**: Removed obsolete speculative comments and zero-width masking behavior around the old clamping path.

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness Growth**: Expanded the default focused harness to 257 passing tests across 18 modules.
*   **Gateway Regression Coverage**: Added regressions for wrapped `x >= cols`, non-wrapped `x >= cols`, and wrapped coordinates that normalize past the terminal rows.

### Documentation
*   **Upgrade Plan**: Marked the `v2.7.9` Gateway Grid FillSpan correctness section complete in `kterm_2_7_6_upgrade_plan.md`.
*   **Harness And Bug Plans**: Updated the focused harness baseline and Gateway test counts.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.9.

## [v2.7.8] - Network Reliability And MTU Probing
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release hardens the optional networking Speedtest state machine and replaces the MTU probe's placeholder local-MTU reporting with platform-backed interface lookup plus a documented fallback.

### Reliability Fixes
*   **Speedtest Phase Guards**: Added explicit per-phase initiation flags for auto-select, download-connect, and upload-connect phases so sockets are not recreated while a phase is already pending.
*   **Socket Failure Handling**: Closed stream sockets and transitioned to the terminal Speedtest state when download or upload socket creation fatally fails.
*   **Upload Send Handling**: Checked upload `send()` return values and closed upload sockets on fatal send errors or remote closure.
*   **MTU Local Interface Lookup**: Added local MTU lookup using `getifaddrs`/`SIOCGIFMTU` on Unix-like platforms and `GetBestInterface`/`GetIfEntry` on Windows.
*   **MTU Fallback Contract**: Preserved `local_mtu = 0` as the documented fallback when platform interface lookup is unavailable or inconclusive.

### Tests
*   **Default Harness**: Default focused harness remains at 254 passing tests with networking disabled.
*   **Optional Networking Growth**: Expanded optional networking coverage to 11 tests; `KTERM_OPTIONAL_NET=1` now reports 265 total passing tests.
*   **Speedtest Regression**: Added optional coverage for guarded Speedtest phase initialization.
*   **MTU Regression**: Added optional coverage for local-MTU initialization and fallback reporting.

### Documentation
*   **Upgrade Plan**: Marked the `v2.7.8` network reliability and MTU probing section complete in `kterm_2_7_6_upgrade_plan.md`.
*   **Harness And Bug Plans**: Updated optional networking counts and verification notes.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.8.

## [v2.7.7] - SSH And Telnet Client String Safety
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release hardens the optional/reference SSH and Telnet clients against unterminated fixed-buffer copies for host, user, terminal type, profile, and automation strings.

### Security Fixes
*   **Shared Client Copy Contract**: Added `kt_client_string.h` with destination-sized string and span copy helpers for optional client code.
*   **SSH Client Safety**: Replaced all `strncpy` uses in `ssh_client.c`, including server-version, config-profile, trigger, credential, session-file host, and terminal-type copies.
*   **Telnet Client Safety**: Replaced host copies in `telnet_client.c` with destination-sized bounded copies.
*   **Automation Listing Safety**: Replaced trigger-list `strcat` appends with bounded `snprintf` appends.

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness Growth**: Expanded the default focused harness to 254 passing tests across 18 modules.
*   **Client String Regression**: Added max-length host/user/path-style copy coverage for shared client string helpers.
*   **Profile Token Regression**: Added span-copy coverage for oversized SSH config/profile token slices and null-source handling.

### Documentation
*   **Upgrade Plan**: Marked the `v2.7.7` SSH/Telnet client string safety section complete in `kterm_2_7_6_upgrade_plan.md`.
*   **Harness And Bug Plans**: Updated the focused harness baseline and security hardening notes to the 254-test result.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.7.

## [v2.7.6] - Security Hardening Round 1
**Release Date:** 2026-05-17

This patch release lands the first post-2.7.5 hardening slice from the upgrade plan, focusing on bounded string copies and destination-sized truncation in console and core terminal paths.

### Security Fixes
*   **Console History Safety**: Replaced unbounded command-history and command-buffer copies in `examples/kterm_console.c` with destination-sized bounded copies and explicit null termination through a shared helper (`ConsoleCopyString`). *(Originally landed in legacy `console.c`; merged into kterm_console.)*
*   **Console Edit Buffer Safety**: Tightened tab-completion and partial-word copies to use bounded `memcpy` only after length checks, preserving explicit terminators.
*   **Function-Key Safety**: Replaced hardcoded function-key copy limits with destination-sized formatting for default mappings, user-defined mappings, and generated key events.
*   **DCS Answerback Safety**: Fixed `KTerm_ExecuteDCSAnswerback()` to truncate against `sizeof(session->answerback_buffer)` instead of `MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER`.
*   **Title And Extension Safety**: Updated terminal/icon title, Gateway extension, soft-font, and ReGIS name copies to use destination buffer sizes.

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness Growth**: Expanded the default focused harness to 252 passing tests across 18 modules.
*   **Answerback Regression**: Added coverage proving oversized DCS answerback payloads truncate to the actual destination buffer.
*   **Input Regression**: Added coverage proving oversized function-key definitions remain bounded through queued key events.
*   **Title Regression**: Added coverage proving oversized window and icon titles are bounded and null-terminated.

### Documentation
*   **Upgrade Plan**: Marked the `v2.7.6` security hardening section complete in `kterm_2_7_6_upgrade_plan.md`.
*   **Harness And Bug Plans**: Updated the focused harness baseline and security hardening notes to the 252-test result.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.6.

## [v2.7.5] - K-Term Harness Hardening And Display Contracts
**Release Date:** 2026-05-16

This patch release closes several harness-discovered K-Term defects and records the remaining backend diagnostic needs in the Situation v2.5 API expansion plan.

### Fixes
*   **Queued Scrollback Metadata**: Fixed queued full-screen scroll operations so `KTerm_ApplyScrollOp()` updates `history_rows_populated`, clamps `view_offset`, and marks the viewport dirty like the internal scroll path.
*   **Public Resize Deadlock**: Fixed a public `KTerm_Resize()` deadlock caused by recursively taking `compositor.render_lock` through `KTermCompositor_Resize()`.
*   **Console Encoding Contract**: Clarified that public write APIs consume VT byte streams: UTF-8 text after `ESC % G`, DEC Special Graphics for legacy line drawing, and explicit replacement behavior for raw CP437 bytes in UTF-8 mode.
*   **Console UTF-8 Reset**: `examples/kterm_console.c` uses UTF-8 mode (`ESC % G`) for the welcome banner (box-drawing via UTF-8 sequences). *(Legacy `console.c` used a DEC Special Graphics border + UTF-8 reset; removed with console merge.)*

### Tests
*   **Focused Harness Growth**: Expanded the default focused harness to 249 passing tests across 18 modules.
*   **Public Scrollback Path**: Moved terminal-core scrollback history tests onto the public queued `KTerm_ScrollUpRegion()` path.
*   **Public Resize Path**: Moved resize stress and display resize invariants back onto public `KTerm_Resize()` after the lock fix.
*   **Encoding Coverage**: Added tests proving UTF-8 box drawing maps to expected CP437 glyph IDs and raw CP437 box bytes are rejected/replaced in UTF-8 mode.
*   **Protocol Negative Coverage**: Added parser tests for APC/PM/SOS no-op accounting and malformed non-report recovery in both strict and permissive modes.

### Documentation
*   **Bug Plan**: Updated `kterm_bug_fix_plan.md` with completed scrollback, resize, encoding, and parser-negative actionables.
*   **Harness Plan**: Updated `kterm_test_harness_plan.md` to reflect the 249-test baseline and new parser/VT coverage.
*   **Situation API Gap**: Added texture readback, texture metadata/sampler, framebuffer readback, and shader-probe proposals to `doc/plan/v2.5-api-expansion.md` for the remaining backend-only K-Term visual diagnostics.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.5.

## [v2.7.4] - Gateway Thread Safety Verification
**Release Date:** 2026-05-27

This patch release validates and documents the thread-safety of the Gateway Protocol's string parsing logic.

### Safety & Stability
*   **Thread Safety**: Validated that `kt_gateway.h` uses a custom reentrant tokenizer (`KTerm_Strtok`) instead of the unsafe standard `strtok`, preventing data corruption during concurrent Gateway command processing.
*   **Verification**: Added regression tests (`tests/verify_gateway_threading.c`) to explicitly verify the thread safety of attribute parsing (`KTerm_ParseAttributeString`) under high concurrency.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.4.

## [v2.7.3] - Network Optimization
**Release Date:** 2026-05-26

This patch release optimizes memory usage in the networking subsystem and fixes a potential stability issue in the Speedtest diagnostic tool.

### Optimization
*   **Network Allocation**: Removed repeated heap allocations for request IDs in Gateway network commands (`ping`, `traceroute`, etc.).
    *   **Architecture**: Introduced inline tag storage (`req_tag`) within network context structures, eliminating `malloc`/`free` cycles for every command.
    *   **Performance**: Benchmarks show a ~4.3% reduction in overhead for the allocation path.
*   **Speedtest Stability**: Fixed a latent Use-After-Free bug where the Speedtest context could be prematurely freed if the latency probe failed to initialize.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.3.

## [v2.7.2] - SSH Automation Optimization
**Release Date:** 2026-05-25

This patch release significantly optimizes the `ssh_client` automation subsystem, enabling high-performance pattern matching for a large number of triggers.

### Performance
*   **Aho-Corasick Automation**: Replaced the O(N*M) iterative `strstr` search in `ssh_client` with an O(M) Aho-Corasick automaton.
    *   **Scale**: Increased the supported automation trigger limit from 16 to 128 (defined by `MAX_TRIGGERS`).
    *   **Speed**: Benchmarks show a ~2.7x speedup when evaluating 1000 triggers against high-throughput data streams.
    *   **Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant string scans, reducing CPU usage during heavy automation workflows.
*   **Maintenance**: Bumped library version to 2.7.2.

## [v2.7.1] - Critical Security Fix for Mock SSH Client
**Release Date:** 2026-05-24

This patch release addresses a security vulnerability in the `ssh_client` reference implementation's "Mock Crypto" mode.

### Security Fixes
*   **Mock Mode Restriction**: The "Mock Crypto" mode (default build without `libssh`) now strictly prohibits connections to non-local hosts. It only allows connections to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`.
    *   **Impact**: Prevents users from inadvertently using the insecure, hardcoded handshake reference implementation to connect to real external servers, which would expose credentials and data in cleartext (or with a trivial mock cipher).
    *   **UI**: Added prominent warnings (`[SECURITY ERROR]`) when attempting unsafe connections in Mock Mode.

    *   Added security-related fields to `KTermProtocolDef` (`supports_auth`, `plaintext_auth`, `high_bruteforce_risk`, `high_relay_risk`, `auth_notes`).
    *   PacketDiag output now appends color-coded risk tags: `[Auth]`, `[PLAIN]`, `[BRUTE]`, `[RELAY]`, and context notes (e.g., "Plaintext credentials").
*   **Deep Payload Inspection**:
    *   Implemented `KTerm_Net_ScanPayloadForAuth` using signature-based heuristics to detect authentication handshakes in active flows (SSH versions, NTLM SSP, Basic Auth headers).
    *   Flow tracking now maintains `auth_detected`, `auth_proto`, and `auth_risk` state.
*   **New Gateway Commands**:
    *   `PROTO_QUERY;port;[UDP]`: Returns security metadata and description for a specific port (e.g., `RISK=1;DESC=Telnet...`).

This prevents crashes when asynchronous resize events race with pending operations, specifically addressing a vulnerability where old coordinates are applied to a new, smaller buffer.
- **Thread Safety**: Introduced `op_queue_lock` in `KTermSession` to protect the operation queue (`KTermOpQueue`) from concurrent access. `KTerm_QueueOp` and `KTerm_FlushOps` now hold this lock, ensuring atomic queuing and flushing of grid mutations.
- **API Update**: Updated `KTerm_QueueOp` to accept `KTermSession*` instead of `KTermOpQueue*` to facilitate session-level locking.
- **Verification**: Added `tests/test_buffer_hardening.c` regression test to validate the fix against the specific resize/copy exploit pattern.

## [v2.6.20] - Library Structure Refactoring
- **Modular Architecture:** Split monolithic `kterm.h` into three files for better maintainability:
  - `kterm_api.h`: Public API declarations (types, structs, function prototypes)
  - `kterm_impl.h`: Core implementation code (when `KTERM_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined)
  - `kterm.h`: Orchestrator that includes API and coordinates all module implementations

## [v2.6.4] - Networking Automation (Phase 4)
- **Automation Triggers:** Implemented Phase 4 of the networking roadmap by adding support for automation triggers in `ssh_client.c`. Triggers allow defining "Expect-Send" style rules in the configuration file (`Trigger "pattern" "action"`).
- **Auto-Response Logic:** The SSH client now scans incoming data streams for configured patterns and automatically injects response text into the channel, enabling automated login sequences, MFA handling, or environment setup.
- **Gateway Automation:** Added `EXT;automate` Gateway extension to allow runtime management of triggers (add/list) from within the terminal session.
- **Config Parsing Fix:** Rewrote the `ssh_client.c` configuration parser to robustly handle quoted strings for Trigger patterns and actions, fixing destructive tokenization issues.

## [v2.6.3] - Networking Convenience (Phase 3)
- **Session Persistence:** Added `--persist` flag to `ssh_client.c`. When enabled, the terminal session state (grid content, cursor, history) is serialized to a file on exit/disconnect and automatically restored on the next connection to the same host. Filenames are sanitized to prevent directory traversal.
- **Config File Support:** Added `--config <file>` support to `ssh_client.c` (defaulting to `ssh_config`). Implemented a parser for standard SSH config directives (`Host`, `HostName`, `User`, `Port`) and K-Term specific extensions (`Durable`, `Term`).
- **Resilience:** Combined with Phase 1 durability, this release makes `ssh_client` a robust, state-preserving remote terminal suitable for standalone use.

## [v2.6.2] - Networking Graphics (Phase 2)
- **High-Throughput Graphics API:** Added `KTerm_WriteRawGraphics` to the core `kterm.h` API. This function bypasses the standard input ring buffer (SPSC), allowing direct, high-speed injection of large binary payloads (like Kitty images or Sixel graphics) after ensuring all pending text is flushed. This prevents buffer overflows and frame drops for heavy graphics workloads.
- **Data Interception Hook:** Updated `KTermNetCallbacks` in `kt_net.h` so the `on_data` callback returns a `bool`. Returning `true` signals that the client has consumed the data, skipping default processing. This enables custom handling of specific escape sequences (e.g., stripping graphics headers).
- **SSH Graphics Pass-Through:** Enhanced `ssh_client.c` with a robust state machine that detects split Kitty (`ESC _ G`) and Sixel (`ESC P q`) sequences across TCP packet boundaries. Detected sequences are buffered and fed directly to `KTerm_WriteRawGraphics`, bypassing the text parser for optimal performance.
- **Clipboard Sync (OSC 52):** Verified and solidified OSC 52 support (Set/Query Clipboard), ensuring remote applications can seamlessly copy text to the host clipboard.
- **Robustness:** Added comprehensive fragmentation handling to the SSH client example to ensure graphics headers split between packets are correctly reassembled and processed.

## [v2.6.1] - Networking Resilience (Phase 1)
- **Session Serialization:** Added `kt_serialize.h` (header-only library) to serialize and deserialize `KTermSession` state (grid content, cursor, scrollback, attributes) to a portable binary format. This lays the groundwork for session persistence.
- **Durable SSH Client:** Enhanced `ssh_client.c` with a `--durable` flag. In this mode, the client automatically attempts to reconnect (every 3 seconds) if the network connection is lost or an error occurs, improving resilience on unstable links.
- **Terminal Type Negotiation:** Added `--term <type>` flag to `ssh_client.c`, allowing users to customize the requested terminal type during the SSH handshake (defaults to `xterm-256color`).
- **Tests:** Added `tests/test_serialize_suite.c` to verify the correctness of the serialization logic (cursor preservation, cell attributes, and content fidelity).

---

## [v2.4.27] - Advanced Grid Ops
- **Grid Streaming**: Added `EXT;grid;stream` for high-performance bulk cell updates.
    - Uses packed binary data (CH+ATTR) encoded in Base64 for escape safety.
    - Supports sparse updates via attribute masks (e.g., update only FG color for a region).
    - Prevents race conditions by flushing the operation queue before read-modify-write cycles.
- **Copy & Move**: Added `EXT;grid;copy` and `EXT;grid;move` subcommands.
    - Performs rectangular blit operations entirely on the GPU/Grid side.
    - `move` automatically clears the source region after copying.
    - Supports overwrite modes (`PROTECTED` bypass).
- **Masked Fill Fix**: Updated `EXT;grid;fill` to correctly utilize `KTERM_OP_FILL_RECT_MASKED`, enabling true masked fills that preserve existing cell attributes (e.g., change background color while keeping text).
- **Safety**: Hardened `stream` against division-by-zero errors by clamping dimensions. Fixed inconsistent viewport bounds checking in internal copy operations.
- **API**: Introduced `KTerm_QueueCopyRectWithMode` to support advanced copy flags while maintaining ABI compatibility for `KTerm_QueueCopyRect`.

## [v2.4.26] - Forms & Relative Grid
- **Forms Mode Enhancements**:
    - **Skip Protect Navigation**: Cursor movement (Right, Left, Tab, Backspace) now automatically skips protected cells (`DECSCA 1`) if `SKIP_PROTECT` is enabled via Gateway (`SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1`).
    - **Configurable Home**: Added `HOME_MODE` to `SET;CURSOR`. Options include `ABSOLUTE` (0,0), `FIRST_UNPROTECTED` (scan grid), `FIRST_UNPROTECTED_LINE` (scan current line), and `LAST_FOCUSED` (return to last known unprotected cell).
    - **Focus Tracking**: The terminal now tracks the last valid cursor position on an unprotected cell for use with `HOME_MODE=LAST_FOCUSED`.
- **Relative Grid Coords**: Gateway Grid operations (`fill`, `fill_circle`, `fill_line`, `banner`) now support relative coordinates prefixed with `+` or `-` (e.g., `x=+5`, `y=-2`).
- **Negative Dimensions**: Negative width/height/length parameters in Grid ops now reverse the drawing direction (mirroring), allowing for intuitive "draw left" or "draw up" commands.
- **Strict Mode**: If `strict_mode` is enabled, negative absolute grid coordinates are clamped to 0, while explicit relative coordinates are preserved.

## [v2.4.25] - Forms & Parser Enhancements
- **Cursor Skip Protect**: Implemented "forms mode" cursor navigation. When enabled (`SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1`), cursor movement commands (`CUF`, `CUB`, `CUD`, `CUU`, etc.) automatically skip over protected cells (`DECSCA 1`), wrapping to the next line if necessary.
- **Signed Numeric Params**: Hardened CSI/OSC/DCS parser to support signed integer parameters (e.g., `CSI -5 ; ...`). Negative values are preserved unless `strict_mode` is enabled, in which case they are clamped to 0.
- **Safe Grid Ops**: Enhanced Gateway Grid operations (`fill`, `fill_circle`, `banner`, `fill_line`) to be out-of-bound safe. They now silently ignore off-screen plots instead of clipping harshly or erroring, and return the count of actually applied (in-bound) cells.
- **Gateway**: Added `SET;CURSOR;SKIP_PROTECT=1` to toggle the new cursor behavior.

## [v2.4.24] - Gateway Grid Flexible Params
- **Flexible Syntax**: Gateway Grid extension (`EXT;grid`) now supports optional/empty parameters (`switch;;;;value`). Omitted parameters default to the current session attributes (if masked in) or are ignored (if masked out).
- **Stencil Mode**: Excluding the `CH` (Character) bit from the mask in `fill` or `banner` commands now acts as a stencil, applying colors and attributes to the shape without modifying the underlying text characters.
- **Design Mode**: Gateway Grid operations now bypass the `PROTECTED` attribute check, enabling host applications to overwrite protected cells (e.g., carving out editable fields in a protected form background).
- **Named Attributes**: Added support for human-readable attribute flags (e.g., `PROTECTED|BOLD`) in Gateway commands via `KTerm_ParseAttributeString`.
- **Robustness**: Replaced `strtok` with a custom tokenizer in `KTerm_Ext_Grid` to correctly handle empty fields in semicolon-separated lists.
- **Fixes**: Resolved a critical regression where DCS payloads containing `p` or `q` (e.g., `pal:1`) incorrectly triggered protocol switches by enforcing strict DCS header validation.

## [v2.4.23] - Gateway Grid Banner
- **Gateway Extensions**: Added `banner` subcommand to the `grid` extension (`EXT;grid;banner;...`).
    - Plots large text directly onto the grid using a built-in bitmap font (IBM 8x8).
    - Supports scaling, alignment (left/center/right), and masked styling (color, attributes).
    - Bypasses escape sequence parsing for high-performance dashboard/overlay construction.

## [v2.4.22] - Gateway Grid Shapes
- **Gateway Extensions**: Expanded `grid` extension with `fill_circle` and `fill_line` subcommands.
    - `fill_circle`: Draws filled circles using the midpoint algorithm.
    - `fill_line`: Draws linear spans in cardinal directions (h, v) with optional wrapping for horizontal lines.
- **Fixes**: Fixed `fill` subcommand to correctly handle 0-width/height arguments (defaulting to 1).
- **Architecture**: Refactored `KTerm_Ext_Grid` to use a shared `GridStyle` helper.

## [v2.4.21] - Gateway Grid Extension
- **Gateway Extensions**: Added `grid` extension for bulk screen manipulation.
- **Commands**: Implemented `EXT;grid;fill` subcommand to efficienty fill rectangular regions with specific characters and attributes.
- **Operations**: Added `KTERM_OP_FILL_RECT_MASKED` to the operation queue to support masked attribute updates (Char, FG, BG, Underline, Strike, Flags).
- **Testing**: Added `tests/test_gateway_grid.c` to verify grid manipulation capabilities.

## [v2.4.20]

### Gateway RAWDUMP & Direct Input
- **RAWDUMP:** Added `rawdump` Gateway extension (`EXT;rawdump;START;SESSION=n`) to mirror raw input bytes to a target session as literal characters. This bypasses the VT parser, enabling powerful debugging and visualization of escape sequences.
- **Direct Input:** Added `direct` Gateway extension (`EXT;direct;1`) to toggle `KTERM_MODE_DIRECT_INPUT` at runtime via the Gateway Protocol, allowing per-session control of local editing modes.
- **Protocol:** Fully integrated with the Gateway Protocol, supporting session targeting (`SESSION=ID`) and explicit acknowledgments ("OK", "ACTIVE", "STOPPED").

## [v2.4.19]

### Unified Event Pipeline & Direct Input
- **Unified Processing:** Introduced `KTerm_ProcessEvent` as the single, centralized entry point for all input types (Bytes, Keys, Mouse, Resize, Focus, Paste), simplifying the integration surface.
- **KTermEvent Union:** Replaced fragmented input structs with a unified `KTermEvent` tagged union, renaming the legacy `KTermEvent` to `KTermKeyEvent` for clarity.
- **Direct Input Mode:** Implemented `KTERM_MODE_DIRECT_INPUT` (Direct Mode). When enabled, printable keys are inserted directly into the grid (Local Editing) without generating VT escape sequences, perfect for local line editing or chat input fields.
- **Centralized Translation:** Moved VT key sequence generation logic from the IO adapter (`kt_io_sit.h`) into the core `KTerm_TranslateKey` function, ensuring consistent behavior across all input sources.
- **API Unification:** `KTerm_WriteChar`, `KTerm_WriteString`, and `KTerm_WriteFormat` now wrap `KTerm_ProcessEvent`, ensuring consistent behavior and overflow handling across all input methods.
- **Mouse Fallback:** `KTerm_ProcessEvent` now gracefully handles mouse wheel events by falling back to standard scrolling (or Alt-Screen arrows) if Mouse Tracking is disabled, preventing "dead scroll" issues.

## [v2.4.18]

### Gateway Extensions
- **Modular Extension System:** Introduced `KTerm_RegisterGatewayExtension` to allow host applications to register custom Gateway commands under the `EXT` namespace (`DCS GATE ... EXT;name;args ST`).
- **Built-in Kittens:** Added built-in extensions for common tasks:
    - **broadcast:** Sends input to all open sessions (`broadcast;text`).
    - **themes:** Sets background color via OSC 11 (`themes;set;bg=#RRGGBB`).
    - **icat:** Basic image injection using the Kitty Graphics Protocol (`icat;base64_data`).
    - **clipboard:** Placeholder for clipboard operations (`clipboard;set;text`, `clipboard;get`).
- **API:** Added `GatewayResponseCallback` and `GatewayExtHandler` typedefs for extension implementation.

## [v2.4.17]

### Input Pipeline Decoupling
- **Architecture:** Replaced the legacy fixed-size `input_pipeline` with a dynamic, lock-free Single-Producer Single-Consumer (SPSC) queue (`KTermInputQueue`) per session. This decouples the input source (host/PTY) from the processing loop, preventing stalls during high-throughput operations.
- **Batch Processing:** Implemented `KTerm_PushInput` for efficient batch injection of input data. The consumer loop now processes events in batches (`burst_threshold`), significantly improving throughput for large pastes or AI streams.
- **Backpressure:** The new queue architecture supports basic backpressure monitoring and overflow detection, laying the groundwork for advanced flow control (XOFF/XON).
- **Diagnostics:** Updated `KTerm_ShowDiagnostics` and `KTerm_GetStatus` to report accurate queue usage metrics.

## [v2.4.16]

### Shader Config Refactor & Hot-Reload
- **Refactoring:** Moved shader visual parameters (CRT curvature, scanline intensity, glow, noise, flags) from Push Constants to a dedicated `ConfigBuffer` (SSBO). This allows for runtime configuration without pipeline reconstruction.
- **Hot-Reload:** Implemented `SET;SHADER` and `GET;SHADER` Gateway commands to dynamically configure visual effects.
- **New Effects:** Added support for Glow (bloom approximation) and Noise effects in the compute shader.
- **Safety:** Replaced `union` with `struct` in `KTermToken` (kt_parser.h) to prevent data corruption during float parsing (type punning fix).
- **Compliance:** Reverted `strtod` to `strtof` in parser logic to maintain strict C11 compliance and portability.

## [v2.4.15]

### Compositor Modularization
- **Modularization:** Extracted the layout compositing logic into a new module `kt_composite_sit.h`, implementing `KTermCompositor`.
- **Decoupling:** Decoupled `KTerm` core from direct render buffer management. The `KTerm` struct now holds a `KTermCompositor` instance.
- **Refactoring:** Moved GPU structure definitions (`GPUCell`, `GPUVectorLine`, etc.) and `KTermRenderBuffer` to the new module.
- **Implementation:** `KTerm_PrepareRenderBuffer`, `KTerm_Draw` logic, and `KTerm_Resize` logic now delegate to `KTermCompositor_*` functions.
- **Fixes:** Addressed dependency issues with `GetScreenRow` and `KTerm_BuildRun` by careful ordering of includes and moving helper functions.

## [v2.4.14]

### Refactoring & Magic Numbers
- **Session Cleanup Refactor:** Extracted `KTerm_CleanupSession` helper function to consolidate and fix memory cleanup logic for session resources (screen buffers, graphics state, macros, etc.), addressing potential leaks in multi-session scenarios.
- **Initialization Refactor:** Extracted `KTerm_ResetSessionDefaults` to separate default state initialization from memory allocation in `KTerm_InitSession`.
- **Magic Numbers:** Replaced hardcoded blink rate oscillator slots with named constants `KTERM_OSC_SLOT_FAST_BLINK` (30) and `KTERM_OSC_SLOT_SLOW_BLINK` (35) for better maintainability.

## [v2.4.13]

### DECRQSS Extensions & Fixes

- **Accuracy:** Added bounds checking to texture sampling to prevent atlas bleeding when distorting glyph coordinates.
- **Completeness:** These attributes are now visually distinct even when using the standard bitmap font, improving readability and styling support.

## [v2.4.9]

### Session Routing, Queries, Macros, State Snapshot
- **Per-Session Response Routing:** Fixed critical data contention issues in multi-session environments. Responses (`DSR`, `OSC`) are now routed exclusively to the originating session's ring buffer (`response_ring`) instead of the active session, ensuring 100% reliable output handling for background tasks.
- **Expanded Query Handlers:** Added support for `CSI ?10n` (Graphics Capabilities), `?20n` (Macro Storage), and `?30n` (Session State). Fixed `CSI 98n` (Error Reporting) to comply with standard syntax.

- **Continuous Fuzzing:** Added `tests/libfuzzer_target.c` and GitHub Actions workflow for continuous regression fuzzing with libFuzzer/AddressSanitizer, targeting parser robustness against malformed sequences.
- **Strict Mode:** Exposed `strict_mode` in `KTermConfig` to enforce stricter parsing rules.

## [v2.4.7]

### Memory & Sanitizer Hardening
- **ReGIS Memory Safety:** Fixed memory leaks in ReGIS macro handling by properly freeing existing macros before re-initialization or reset commands (`RESET;REGIS`).
- **Shutdown Cleanup:** Enhanced `KTerm_Cleanup` to ensure all internal buffers (e.g., `row_dirty`, `row_scratch_buffer`) are freed, eliminating leaks on session destruction.
- **Buffer Hardening:** Mitigated buffer overflow risks in `KTerm_SetLevel` by enforcing correct size limits on the answerback buffer.
- **Sanitizer Compliance:** The codebase is now verified clean under AddressSanitizer (ASan) and Valgrind, ensuring robust operation in CI environments.

## [v2.4.6]

### Conversational UI Hardening
- **Synchronized Output (DECSET 2026):** Implemented support for synchronized updates to prevent visual tearing during rapid text streaming (e.g., from LLMs).
- **Focus Tracking:** Added support for `CSI ? 1004 h` (Focus In/Out events) and introduced `KTerm_SetFocus` API to report focus state to the terminal.
- **Clipboard Hardening:** Increased `MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER` to 256KB to support large clipboard operations via OSC 52, ensuring robust handling of large pastes.
- **Tests:** Added `tests/stress_interleaved_io.c` for I/O stress testing and `tests/mock_situation.h` for robust unit testing without external dependencies. Expanded `tests/verify_clipboard.c` to test large payloads.
- **Fixes:** Resolved compilation issues in tests by introducing a mock layer for the Situation framework.

## [v2.4.5]

### Hardened Conversational Interface & Kitty Protocol
- **Kitty Keyboard Protocol:** Full implementation of the progressive keyboard enhancement protocol (`CSI > 1 u`), enabling unambiguous key reporting (distinguishing `Tab` vs `Ctrl+I`, `Enter` vs `Ctrl+Enter`), explicit modifier reporting (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Super), and key release events.
- **Input Hardening:** Introduced `KTermKey` enum for standardized key codes and hardened the `ParseCSI` logic to correctly handle modern prefix parameters (e.g., `>`).
- **Ring Buffer Integration:** Finalized the per-session `response_ring` integration for robust, lock-free output interleaving in high-throughput conversational scenarios (AI streaming, chat UIs).

## [v2.4.4]

### Conversational Completeness & Output Refactor
- **Per-Session Output Ring:** Replaced the legacy linear output buffer with a lock-free, per-session ring buffer (`response_ring`). This ensures thread-safe, non-blocking response generation in multi-session environments and prevents data drops under load.
- **Expanded Query Support:** Added new DSR queries for inspecting internal state:
    -   `CSI ? 10 n`: Graphics capabilities bitmask (Sixel, ReGIS, Kitty, etc.).
    -   `CSI ? 20 n`: Macro storage usage (slots used, free bytes).
    -   `CSI ? 30 n`: Session state (active ID, max sessions, scroll region).
    -   `CSI 98 n`: Internal error count.
- **Macro Acknowledgments:** Macro definitions now reply with `DCS > ID ; Status ST` (0=Success, 1=Full, 2=Error), allowing hosts to verify uploads.
- **Gateway State Snapshot:** New `GET;STATE` command returns a packed, comprehensive snapshot of the terminal's state (cursor, modes, attributes, scroll region) for seamless reattachment or debugging.

## [v2.4.3]

### Multi-Session Graphics & Lifecycle Fixes
- **Tektronix Isolation:** Moved Tektronix graphics state from global storage to per-session storage (`KTermSession`), ensuring that vector graphics in one session do not bleed into others. Updated `ProcessTektronixChar` and initialization logic to use the session-specific context.
- **Kitty Lifecycle:** Fixed Kitty graphics lifecycle issues during resize events. Implemented `KTerm_ApplyResizeOp` remapping logic to correctly update the logical `start_row` of images when the terminal grid is resized, preventing visual artifacts or lost images in the scrollback buffer.
- **Initialization:** Standardized graphics subsystem initialization (Sixel, ReGIS, Tektronix, Kitty) within `KTerm_InitSession`, removing redundant global initialization code and ensuring all sessions start with a clean, isolated state.
- **API Update:** Updated `KTerm_InitKitty` signature to match Sixel/ReGIS patterns for consistency.

## [v2.4.2]

### Stabilization & Lifecycle Fixes
- **Graphics Lifecycle:** Fixed a confirmed memory leak where Sixel graphics data for background sessions was not correctly freed during `KTerm_Cleanup`.
- **ReGIS Isolation:** Enforced strict per-session isolation for ReGIS state (colors, positions, macros) by updating `KTerm_InitReGIS` to accept an explicit session context. This resolves potential state crosstalk in multi-session environments.
- **Documentation:** Updated API documentation to transparently acknowledge that while ReGIS *state* is isolated, the vector output layer is currently a global shared resource. Sixel rendering is also clarified as being limited to the active session overlay for now.
- **Testing:** Added comprehensive stress tests (`stress_op_queue`, `stress_resize`) and isolation verification (`verify_regis_isolation`) to the test suite.

## [v2.4.1]

### ReGIS Per-Session State
- **Refactoring:** Moved ReGIS graphics state (cursor position, macros, colors) from the global `KTerm` struct to the per-session `KTermSession` struct. This ensures that in multi-session environments (e.g., split panes or background sessions), each terminal session maintains its own independent graphics context.
- **Cleanup:** Fixed a duplicate `struct` definition issue where a block of code defining `regis` was erroneously duplicated in the header. Extracted the ReGIS state definition into a named `KTermReGIS` typedef for clarity.
- **API Update:** Updated `KTerm_InitReGIS` and internal helpers to operate on specific session instances.

## [v2.4.0]

### Finalize Op Queue Decoupling – Mandatory Mode Achieved

- Made op queue **mandatory** (removed `use_op_queue` flag and all fallback paths).
- All grid mutations (cell set, scroll, rect ops, vertical insert/delete, resize) now unconditionally queue operations.
- Added `KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID` + full queuing for dynamic resizes (Gateway/host-triggered).
- Cleaned up struct ordering, forward declarations, font includes, and test compilation issues.
- Tests: `test_full_decoupling.c` verifies deferred mutations; rect/vertical suites pass cleanly.
- Docs: Updated to reflect mandatory queue, full coverage, and post-flush grid purity.

This completes the multi-version refactor arc (started v2.3.40) — grid is now fully declarative/batched, thread-safe, and directly addressable after flush. Ready for per-cell extensions, bytecode, and next-gen renderer integration.

## [v2.3.44] (pre-release)
- Cleaned up struct ordering, forward declarations, font includes, and test compilation issues.
- Tests: `test_full_decoupling.c` verifies deferred mutations; rect/vertical suites pass cleanly.
- Docs: Updated to reflect mandatory queue, full coverage, and post-flush grid purity.

This completes the multi-version refactor arc (started v2.3.40) — grid is now fully declarative/batched, thread-safe, and directly addressable after flush. Ready for per-cell extensions, bytecode, and next-gen renderer integration.

## [v2.3.43]

### Mandatory Op Queue & Decoupling
- **Architecture:** Completed core refactoring to make the `KTermOpQueue` mandatory and fully decoupled from direct grid mutation.
- **Queue Expansion:** Added `KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID` to `kt_ops.h` and increased queue capacity to 16384 to handle bursty resize events.
- **Unified Mutation:** Updated all grid mutation functions (`InsertLines`, `DeleteLines`, `Scroll`, `Insert/DeleteChar`, `RectOps`) to unconditionally queue operations, removing the `use_op_queue` flag.
- **Resize Logic:** Refactored `KTerm_ResizeSession` to queue resize operations (`KTERM_OP_RESIZE_GRID`) instead of applying them immediately, ensuring thread safety and rendering consistency (direct application remains available via `KTERM_DEBUG_DIRECT`).
- **Testing:** Added `tests/test_full_decoupling.c` to verify that complex mutations like resizes and line insertions are correctly deferred until the flush phase.

## [v2.3.42]

### Expanded Input Op Queue
- **Vertical Ops:** Added support for `INSERT_LINES` (IL) and `DELETE_LINES` (DL) in the `KTermOpQueue`.
- **Scrolling:** Refactored `KTerm_ScrollUpRegion_Internal` and `KTerm_ScrollDownRegion_Internal` to queue `SCROLL_REGION` ops when `use_op_queue` is active.
- **Refactoring:** Updated internal handlers for `ExecuteIL` and `ExecuteDL` to utilize the queue.
- **Optimization:** Vertical line operations are now applied atomically during the flush phase, with correct protected cell handling (aborting if protected cells are in the region).

## [v2.3.41]

### Expanded Input Op Queue
- **Rectangular Ops:** Added support for `FILL_RECT`, `COPY_RECT` (DECCRA), and `SET_ATTR_RECT` (DECCARA/DECRARA) in the `KTermOpQueue`.
- **Refactoring:** Updated internal handlers for `ExecuteDECFRA`, `KTerm_CopyRectangle`, and `ExecuteDECCARA` to utilize the queue when `session->use_op_queue` is active.
- **Optimization:** Rectangular operations are now applied atomically during the flush phase, reducing potential visual tearing and improving batching efficiency.

## [v2.3.40]

### New Features & Optimizations
- **Input Op Queue:** Implemented a lock-free input operation queue (`KTermOpQueue`) to decouple input parsing from direct grid mutation. This allows for atomic batch updates and improves thread safety during high-throughput scenarios.
- **JIT Text Shaping:** Introduced Just-In-Time text shaping (`KTermTextRun`). The renderer now dynamically groups characters (e.g., base characters + combining marks) into logical runs at render time. This resolves longstanding issues with combining character display and ensures correct visual representation without complicating the underlying grid storage.
- **Combining Character Storage:** Combining characters are now stored in their own grid cells with the `KTERM_FLAG_COMBINING` flag, preserving the input stream's integrity while allowing the JIT renderer to collapse them visually.
- **Dirty Rect Optimization:** The flush logic now calculates a minimal `dirty_rect` for pending operations. `KTerm_PrepareRenderBuffer` utilizes this to perform partial GPU buffer uploads, significantly reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance on large terminals or during partial updates.

### Safety & Stability
- **Leak Fix:** Fixed a memory leak in `KTerm_Cleanup` where the `KTermLayout` structure was not being freed, particularly in scenarios where initialization failed after layout creation.
- **Destruction Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_Destroy` to delegate all resource cleanup to `KTerm_Cleanup`, ensuring a single source of truth for teardown logic.
- **Safety:** Added pointer nullification after freeing resources in `KTerm_Cleanup` to prevent double-free vulnerabilities if the cleanup function is invoked multiple times.

## [v2.3.38]

### Output Architecture
- **Sink Output Pattern:** Introduced `KTerm_SetOutputSink` to allow applications to register a direct output callback (`KTermOutputSink`). This enables zero-copy data transmission from the terminal to the host, bypassing the legacy ring buffer. This is ideal for high-throughput scenarios.
- **Unified Output Logic:** Refactored the internal output system (`KTerm_WriteInternal`) to consolidate logic for both legacy buffered output and the new direct sink output. This eliminates code duplication between `KTerm_QueueResponse` and `KTerm_QueueResponseBytes`.
- **Binary Safety:** The new write primitive correctly distinguishes between string and binary data, ensuring null terminators are only appended when appropriate and preventing buffer corruption for binary protocols.
- **Automatic Flushing:** Setting a new output sink automatically flushes any data remaining in the legacy buffer to the new sink, ensuring no data loss during transition.

## [v2.3.37]

### Architecture & Layout
- **Layout Engine Decoupling:** Extracted the multiplexer layout engine logic into a new `kt_layout.h` module.
- **Modular Design:** `KTerm_Resize`, `KTerm_SplitPane`, and `KTerm_ClosePane` now delegate to the `KTermLayout` API, decoupling geometry calculations from the terminal emulation core.
- **Refactoring:** Replaced embedded `KTermPane` structures in `KTerm` with a `KTermLayout*` handle, paving the way for alternative layout strategies (tabs, floating windows).

## [v2.3.36]

### Error Reporting & Stability
- **Structured API:** Introduced a new error reporting system with `KTermErrorLevel`, `KTermErrorSource`, and user callbacks (`KTerm_SetErrorCallback`). This replaces ad-hoc `stderr` logging with a unified mechanism.
- **Integration:** Integrated error reporting into critical paths: `KTerm_InitSession` (memory), `KTerm_Resize` (buffer alloc), `KTerm_LoadFont` (file IO), `KTerm_InitCompute` (pipeline), and Gateway (unknown commands).
- **Hardening:** Fixed a potential heap corruption issue in `KTerm_Resize` where a failed buffer reallocation would update the size counter without updating the buffer capacity, leading to out-of-bounds writes. The new logic safely caps the size and reports a fatal error.
- **Gateway:** Updated `KTerm_GatewayProcess` to report unknown commands via the new error API (Level: WARNING, Source: API).

## [v2.3.35]

### Hardening & Safety
- **Parser Hardening:** Updated `Stream_ReadInt` and `Stream_ReadHex` in `kt_parser.h` to use `long long` accumulators and check for integer overflows, ensuring robustness against malformed input.
- **Safe Allocations:** Implemented `KTerm_Malloc`, `KTerm_Calloc`, `KTerm_Realloc`, and `KTerm_Free` wrappers in `kterm.h`. `KTerm_Calloc` now checks for multiplication overflows.
- **Refactoring:** Replaced all standard library allocation calls with the new safe wrappers.
- **Testing:** Added `tests/fuzz_harness.c` to support fuzz testing of the input processing pipeline.

## [v2.3.34]

### Unicode Support
- **Unicode Width:** Implemented `mk_wcwidth` logic for accurate character width calculation (0, 1, or 2 cells).
- **Opt-In Control:** Added `enable_wide_chars` flag (default `false`) to `KTermSession` to maintain fixed-width compatibility by default.
- **Gateway:** Added `SET;WIDE_CHARS;ON` command to enable the new logic.
- **Rendering:** Updated `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar` and `KTerm_InsertCharacterAtCursor` to respect character widths when enabled, improving CJK rendering and combining character handling.

## [v2.3.33]

### Protected Cells & Standards
- **Hardened Protected Cells:** Updated `ICH`, `DCH`, `IL`, `DL`, and scroll operations to strictly respect `DECSCA` (Select Character Protection Attribute). Operations are now blocked or modified if they would displace or overwrite protected characters, ensuring compliance with DEC VT520 standards.
- **Smart Protection:** Refined insertion/deletion logic to allow edits if the cursor is past the protected field (non-destructive shifts), improving usability for forms.

## v2.3.32] (Pre-Release)

### Parser Unification & Robustness
- **Parser Dispatcher:** Introduced `KTerm_DispatchSequence` to centralize execution of all buffered sequences (OSC, DCS, APC, PM, SOS), ensuring uniform termination and error handling.
- **OSC Refactor:** Rewrote `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand` and its helpers (`ProcessKTermColorCommand`, `ProcessClipboardCommand`, etc.) to use `StreamScanner`. This eliminates `atoi`/`strchr`, adds robust parsing for `rgb:` colors and Base64 payloads, and aligns with the DCS refactor.
- **DCS Hardening:** Updated `KTerm_ExecuteDCSCommand` to dispatch sub-commands (GATE, XTGETTCAP, DECUDK) using token matching.
- **Safety Fix:** Fixed a potential buffer overflow in `ProcessSoftFontDownload` by adding explicit bounds checks to the `Dscs` string parser loop.
- **Consistency:** Standardized bounds checking in `KTerm_ProcessGenericStringChar`, `KTerm_ProcessOSCChar`, and `KTerm_ProcessDCSChar`.

## [v2.3.31]

### Parser Unification
- **Parser Unification:** Complete unification of parsing logic for OSC and DCS sequences using safe `StreamScanner` primitives.
- **Safe OSC Parsing:** Replaced unsafe string manipulation (e.g., `atoi`, `strchr`) in `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand` with safe parsing.
- **Full OSC Color Support:** OSC commands 10, 11, and 12 (Foreground, Background, Cursor Color) now support setting colors via `rgb:rr/gg/bb` syntax, in addition to query functionality.
- **DCS Dispatcher Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_ExecuteDCSCommand` to use structured token matching instead of brittle `strncmp` checks. This fixes potential ambiguity between Soft Font downloads (`2;1|`) and User Defined Keys (`0;1|`).
- **Memory Safety:** Removed legacy usage of `strdup` in clipboard (OSC 52) and key definition parsing, eliminating potential heap fragmentation and leaks.

## v2.3.30]

### Gateway Protocol Refactor
- **Dispatcher:** Refactored `kt_gateway.h` to use a binary search dispatch table for high-level commands (`SET`, `GET`, `RESET`, `PIPE`, `INIT`), replacing the legacy linear string comparison model. This improves maintainability and extensibility.
- **Parsing Primitives:** Added robust `StreamScanner` primitives (`Stream_ReadIdentifier`, `Stream_ReadBool`, `Stream_MatchToken`, `Stream_PeekChar`) to `kt_parser.h`.
- **Parameter Parsing:** Updated Gateway handlers to leverage these primitives for cleaner, safer, and more efficient parameter extraction (e.g., boolean flags like `ON`/`OFF`, `TRUE`/`FALSE`).
- **Safety:** Enhanced bounds checking and whitespace handling across the Gateway parsing logic.

## [v2.3.29]

### Robustness & Safety
- **CSI Parsing Refactor:** Refactored CSI parameter parsing (`kterm.h`) to use `StreamScanner` primitives. The new implementation robustly handles non-numeric garbage in parameter strings by treating it as a default value (0) and advancing to the next separator (`:` or `;`) or end of string, preventing parsing aborts and data loss.
- **Gateway Quoted Strings:** Enhanced `KTermLexer` in `kt_parser.h` to correctly handle escaped quotes (`\"`) within strings, preventing premature termination.
- **Gateway Unescaping:** Added `KTerm_UnescapeString` utility to process standard escapes (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`) in quoted string tokens. Updated `kt_gateway.h` to use this for all string value parsing (e.g., `TEXT`, `FONT` in banners).

## [v2.3.28]

### Refactoring & Safety
- **Centralized Parsing:** Moved parsing primitives (`StreamScanner`, `Stream_ReadInt`) from `kterm.h` to `kt_parser.h` to eliminate code duplication and enforce a single source of truth for parsing logic.
- **Parsing Primitives:** Added `Stream_ReadHex`, `Stream_ReadFloat`, and `Stream_SkipWhitespace` to `kt_parser.h` to support broader parsing requirements.
- **Gateway Hardening:** Refactored `KTerm_ParseColor` in `kt_gateway.h` to use the safe `StreamScanner` primitives instead of `sscanf`, eliminating potential buffer overflow risks and improving parsing consistency.

## [v2.3.27]

### Architecture & Parsing
- **New Tokenizer:** Introduced `KTermLexer` in `kt_parser.h`, a non-destructive, re-entrant tokenizer.
- **Gateway Parsing:** Updated `kt_gateway.h` to use `KTermLexer` for robust parsing of attributes (`SET;ATTR`), keyboard settings, and banners. This eliminates reliance on `strtok` and improves thread safety.
- **Composite Values:** Implemented logic to parse composite values like RGB colors (`UL=255,0,0`) and gradients (`GRADIENT=C1|C2`) using the new lexer stream.
- **Cleanup:** Removed unused legacy tokenizer (`KTerm_Tokenize`) from `kterm.h`.

## [v2.3.26]

### New Features
- **Sixel Gateway Support:** Implemented full Sixel support in the Gateway Protocol, allowing advanced session targeting and control.
    - **Session Targeting:** Added `SET;SIXEL_SESSION;id` to route Sixel graphics to a specific session (rendering target) regardless of the parsing session (source).
    - **Initialization:** Added `INIT;SIXEL_SESSION` to initialize Sixel graphics state on the target session.
    - **Reset Control:** Added `RESET;SIXEL` to clear Sixel graphics state and `RESET;SIXEL_SESSION` to reset the routing target.
- **API Alignment:** Aligned Sixel Gateway commands with existing ReGIS, Tektronix, and Kitty implementations for consistency.

## [v2.3.25]

### Stability & Performance
- **Resize Throttling:** Implemented a resize throttle mechanism in `KTerm_Resize` (limit ~30 FPS) to prevent allocation thrashing and expensive GPU resource recreation during rapid window drag events.
- **Resize Locking:** Added global mutex locking (`KTERM_MUTEX_LOCK`) to `KTerm_Resize` to prevent race conditions with the update loop (`KTerm_Update`) when modifying layout trees and buffers.
- **Precision Mouse:** Upgraded `KTermSit_UpdateMouse` to use floating-point math (`floorf`) and dynamic character dimensions (`term->char_width`) for coordinate calculation, ensuring accuracy on high-DPI displays or when using non-integer scaling.

## [v2.3.24]

### Safety & Stability
- **Gateway Hardening:** Extensive hardening of the Gateway Protocol implementation in `kt_gateway.h`.
    - **Safe String Handling:** Replaced unsafe string functions with bounded alternatives (`SAFE_STRNCPY`, `snprintf`) to prevent buffer overflows.
    - **Heap Allocation:** Moved the `KTerm_GenerateBanner` line buffer (32KB) from the stack to the heap to prevent stack exhaustion on constrained systems.
    - **Robust Parsing:** Replaced `atoi` with `strtol` for safe integer parsing and added comprehensive null-pointer checks to public APIs.
    - **Validation:** Added input validation for Gateway commands to gracefully handle malformed or malicious inputs.

## [v2.3.23]

### New Features
- **Safe Gateway Resize:** Implemented `SET;WIDTH;val` and `SET;HEIGHT;val` commands in the Gateway Protocol, allowing dynamic screen resizing via escape sequences.
- **Safety Limits:** Updated `SET;SIZE` and new resize commands to clamp dimensions to safe internal limits (`KTERM_MAX_COLS` and `KTERM_MAX_ROWS`, default 2048) to prevent memory exhaustion or GPU texture errors.

## [v2.3.22]

### New Features
- **Software Keyboard Repeater Option:** Added `SET;KEYBOARD;REPEAT=SOFTWARE|HOST` to the Gateway Protocol. Users can now choose between the authentic software-based repeater (default, precise VT timing) or standard host OS repeats (lower latency for remote connections).
- **Session Resize Integration:** Updated `DECSLPP` (Set Lines Per Page) to trigger an immediate session resize and reflow via `KTerm_ResizeSession_Internal`. This ensures that changing the logical page size physically resizes the terminal viewport as expected by modern applications.

### Refactoring
- **Input Logic:** Updated `KTermSit_UpdateKeyboard` to conditionally respect the new `use_software_repeat` flag, enabling pass-through of OS repeat events when configured.

## [v2.3.21]

### Refactoring
- **Version Macros:** Defined `KTERM_VERSION_MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`, and `REVISION` macros in `kterm.h` to centralize version management.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Updated the Gateway Protocol (`GET;VERSION`) to report the version string dynamically constructed from these macros, eliminating hardcoded version strings in the implementation.
- **Cleanup:** Removed the manual version number from the `kterm.h` header comment to prevent desynchronization.

## [v2.3.20]

### Refactoring & Optimization
- **Bitwise Feature Flags:** Replaced the `VTFeatures` struct (which contained multiple boolean fields) with a single `uint32_t` bitmask. This change reduces memory footprint, improves cache locality, and aligns with standard C practices for feature flags.
- **Macros:** Defined `KTERM_FEATURE_*` macros for all supported terminal capabilities (e.g., `KTERM_FEATURE_SIXEL_GRAPHICS`, `KTERM_FEATURE_MOUSE_TRACKING`).
- **Struct Reorganization:** Moved `max_session_count` out of the feature flags bitmask and directly into `VTConformance` and `VTLevelFeatureMapping`, as it is an integer value rather than a boolean flag.
- **Codebase Update:** Updated all internal logic in `kterm.h` and `kt_io_sit.h`, as well as test suites, to use bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `~`) for checking and setting features.

## [v2.3.19]

### New Features
- **Esoteric VT510 Features:** Implemented five more rare VT510 control sequences:
    - **DECRQTSR (Request Terminal State Report):** `CSI ? Ps $ u` allows querying the terminal's state, including a "Factory Defaults" report (`DECRQDE`).
    - **DECRQUPSS (Request User-Preferred Supplemental Set):** `CSI ? 26 u` reports the preferred supplemental character set (handled within `DECRQPKU` logic).
    - **DECARR (Set Auto-Repeat Rate):** `CSI Ps SP r` sets the keyboard auto-repeat rate (0-30Hz) and delay.
    - **DECRQDE (Request Default Settings):** Accessible via `DECRQTSR` with Ps=53.
    - **DECST8C (Select Tab Stops every 8 Columns):** `CSI ? 5 W` resets tab stops to standard 8-column intervals.
- **Software Keyboard Repeater:** Implemented a software-based keyboard repeater in `kt_io_sit.h` to support `DECARR`. This suppresses OS/host-level repeats and generates repeats internally with configurable delay and rate, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
- **Gateway Protocol:** Added `SET;KEYBOARD;REPEAT_RATE`, `SET;KEYBOARD;DELAY`, and `RESET;TABS;DEFAULT8` to the Gateway Protocol.

## [v2.3.18]

    - **DECSNLS (Set Number of Lines per Screen):** `CSI Ps * |` changes the physical screen height.
    - **DECSLPP (Set Lines Per Page):** `CSI Ps * {` sets the logical page size (lines per page).
    - **DECXRLM (Transmit XOFF/XON on Receive Limit):** `CSI ? 88 h` enables flow control logic based on input buffer fill levels (75%/25% hysteresis).
    - **DECRQPKU (Request Programmed Key):** `CSI ? 26 ; Ps u` allows querying User-Defined Key (UDK) definitions.
    - **DECSKCV (Select Keyboard Variant):** `CSI Ps SP =` allows setting the keyboard language variant.

## [v2.3.17]

### Refactoring & Stability
- **ExecuteSM/ExecuteRM Refactor:** Completely refactored `ExecuteSM` (Set Mode) and `ExecuteRM` (Reset Mode) to delegate all logic to a centralized `KTerm_SetModeInternal` function. This eliminates code duplication, fixes split logic issues, and ensures consistent behavior for all modes.
- **Mouse Mode Consolidation:** Unified logic for all mouse tracking modes (1000-1016), fixing issues where disabling one mode wouldn't correctly reset the state or would conflict with others.

### New Features
- **Missing DEC Private Modes:** Implemented previously missing modes:
    - **Mode 64 (DECSCCM):** Multi-Session support (Page/Session management).
    - **Mode 67 (DECBKM):** Backarrow Key Mode (restored and verified).
    - **Mode 68 (DECKBUM):** Keyboard Usage Mode.
    - **Mode 103 (DECHDPXM):** Half-Duplex Mode.
    - **Mode 104 (DECESKM):** Secondary Keyboard Language Mode.
- **ANSI Mode 12 (SRM):** Implemented standard ANSI Mode 12 (Send/Receive Mode), correctly mapping it to Local Echo logic (inverted from DEC Private Mode 12).

### Testing
- **Coverage:** Added `tests/test_modes_coverage.c` to rigorously verify SM/RM sequences for critical modes and edge cases (e.g., VT52 transition, mouse mode interactions).

## [v2.3.16]

### New Features

## [v2.3.15]

### Critical Fixes
- **Fixed Active Session Context Trap:** Resolved a critical architectural bug where processing input for background sessions would incorrectly modify the currently active (foreground) session's state (cursor position, attributes, modes). Background sessions now update their own internal buffers independently of the display.
- **Multiplexing Stability:** Input routing and command execution are now strictly isolated per session, preventing "ghost cursor" movements and attribute bleeding between split panes.

### Architecture & Refactoring
- **Explicit Session Context:** Refactored internal `Execute*`, `Process*`, and helper functions to accept an explicit `KTermSession*` argument instead of relying on the global `GET_SESSION(term)` macro.
- **Header Reorganization:** Moved `KTermSession` struct definition to the top of `kterm.h`. This ensures inline helper functions (e.g., `GetScreenRow`) can properly dereference session pointers without forward declaration errors.
- **Callback Safety:** Updated `KTerm_ResizeSession_Internal` to safely derive the session index via pointer arithmetic, ensuring correct `session_resize_callback` invocation during resize events.

### Thread Safety
- **Tokenizer Replacement:** Removed all usages of the non-reentrant `strtok` function in `kt_gateway.h` and core parsing logic. Replaced with `KTerm_Tokenize` (a custom re-entrant implementation) to prevent data corruption when multiple sessions parse commands simultaneously.
- **Locking Strategy:** Enforced `KTERM_MUTEX_LOCK` usage during `KTerm_Update` (event processing) and `KTerm_ResizeSession` to protect session state during concurrent access.

### Gateway Protocol
- Updated `kt_gateway.h` to utilize the new thread-safe tokenizer for parsing `DCS GATE` commands and banner options.
- Improved targeting logic to ensure Gateway commands (e.g., setting colors or attributes) apply to the specifically targeted session ID, not just the active one.

## v2.3.14
