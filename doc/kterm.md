### 1.3. Architectural Deep Dive

This section provides a more detailed examination of the library's internal components and data flow, expanding on the brief overview. Understanding this architecture is key to extending the library or diagnosing complex emulation issues.

#### 1.3.1. Core Philosophy and The `KTerm` Struct

The library's design is centered on a single, comprehensive data structure: the `KTerm` struct. This monolithic struct, defined in `kterm.h`, encapsulates the entire state of the emulated device.

In **v2.2**, `KTerm` acts as a hypervisor/multiplexer. Instead of managing a single state, it holds:
-   An array of `KTermSession` structs (up to `MAX_SESSIONS`), each representing a virtual terminal with its own screen buffer, cursor, and parser state.
-   A `KTermPane` tree (`layout_root`), defining how these sessions are tiled on the screen.
-   Global resources like the GPU pipeline, font texture, and shared input/output buffers.

The API remains **instance-based** (`KTerm*`), allowing multiple independent multiplexer instances to coexist.

#### 1.3.2. The Input Pipeline

The terminal is a consumer of sequential character data. The entry point for all incoming data from a host application (e.g., a shell, a remote server) is the input pipeline.

-   **Mechanism:** A fixed-size circular buffer (`input_pipeline`) of `unsigned char`.
-   **Ingestion:** Host applications use `KTerm_WriteChar(term, ...)`, `KTerm_WriteString(term, ...)` to append data to this buffer. These functions are intended for use from the main application thread.
-   **Flow Control:** The pipeline has a fixed size (`16384` bytes). If the host writes data faster than the terminal can process it, an overflow flag (`pipeline_overflow`) is set. This allows the host application to detect the overflow and potentially pause data transmission.

#### 1.3.3. The Processing Loop and State Machine

The heart of the emulation is the main processing loop within `KTerm_Update(term)`, which drives a sophisticated state machine.

-   **Consumption:** `KTerm_Update(term)` calls `KTerm_ProcessEvents(term)`, which consumes a tunable number of characters from the input pipeline each frame. This prevents the emulation from freezing the application when large amounts of data are received. The number of characters processed can be adjusted for performance (`VTperformance` struct).
-   **Parsing:** Each character is fed into `KTerm_ProcessChar()`, which acts as a dispatcher based on the current `VTParseState`.
    -   `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`: In the default state, printable characters are sent to the screen, and control characters (like `ESC` or C0 codes) change the parser's state.
    -   `VT_PARSE_ESCAPE`: After an `ESC` (`0x1B`) is received, the parser enters this state, waiting for the next character to determine the type of sequence (e.g., `[` for CSI, `]` for OSC).
    -   `PARSE_CSI`, `PARSE_OSC`, `PARSE_DCS`, etc.: In these states, the parser accumulates parameters and intermediate bytes into `escape_buffer` until a final character (terminator) is received.
    -   **Execution:** Once a sequence is complete, a corresponding `Execute...()` function is called (e.g., `KTerm_ExecuteCSICommand`, `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand`). `KTerm_ExecuteCSICommand` uses a highly efficient computed-goto dispatch table to jump directly to the handler for the specific command (`ExecuteCUU`, `ExecuteED`, etc.), minimizing lookup overhead.

#### 1.3.4. The Screen Buffer

The visual state of the terminal is stored in one of two screen buffers, both of which are 2D arrays of `EnhancedTermChar`.

   **`EnhancedTermChar`:** This crucial struct represents a single character cell on the screen. It goes far beyond a simple `char`, storing:
    -   The Unicode codepoint (`ch`).
    -   Foreground and background colors (`ExtendedColor`), which can be an indexed palette color or a 24-bit RGB color.
    -   A comprehensive set of boolean flags for attributes like `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `blink`, `reverse`, `strikethrough`, `conceal`, and more.
    -   Flags for DEC special modes like double-width or double-height characters (currently unsupported).
-   **Primary vs. Alternate Buffer:** The terminal maintains `screen` and `alt_screen`. Applications like `vim` or `less` switch to the alternate buffer (`CSI ?1049 h`) to create a temporary full-screen interface. When they exit, they switch back (`CSI ?1049 l`), restoring the original screen content and scrollback.

#### 1.3.5. The Rendering Engine (The Compositor)

The v2.2 rendering engine has evolved into a **Compositor**. The `KTerm_Draw()` function orchestrates a multi-pass GPU pipeline:

1.  **Layout Traversal:** It iterates through the `layout_root` tree to calculate the absolute screen viewport for each visible leaf pane.
2.  **SSBO Update:** `KTerm_UpdateSSBO()` uploads content from each visible session into a global `GPUCell` staging buffer, respecting pane boundaries.
3.  **Compute Dispatch (Text):** The core `terminal.comp` shader renders the text grid for the entire screen in one pass.
4.  **Overlay Pass (Graphics):** A new `texture_blit.comp` pipeline is dispatched to draw media elements:
    -   **Sixel Graphics:** Rendered from a dedicated texture.
    -   **Kitty Graphics:** Images are composited with full Alpha Blending and Z-Index support (background images behind text, foreground images on top).
    -   **ReGIS/Vectors:** Vector graphics are drawn as an overlay layer.
5.  **Presentation:** The final composited image is presented to the screen.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Clear["Clear Screen (1x1 Black)"] --> Background["Background Images (Kitty z<0)"]
    Background --> Text["Text Grid (Compute Shader)"]
    Text --> Foreground["Foreground Images (Sixel, Kitty z>=0)"]
    Foreground --> Vectors["Vector Overlay (ReGIS/Tektronix)"]
    Vectors --> Present["Final Output"]
```

#### 1.3.6. The Output Pipeline (Response System)

The terminal needs to send data back to the host in response to certain queries or events. This is handled by the output pipeline, or response system.

-   **Mechanism:** When the terminal needs to send a response (e.g., a cursor position report `CSI {row};{col} R`), it doesn't send it immediately. Instead, it queues the response string into an `answerback_buffer`.
-   **Events:** The following events generate responses:
    -   **User Input:** Keystrokes (`KTerm_UpdateKeyboard(term)`) and mouse events (`KTerm_UpdateMouse(term)`) are translated into the appropriate VT sequences and queued.
    -   **Status Reports:** Commands like `DSR` (Device Status Report) or `DA` (Device Attributes) queue their predefined response strings.
-   **Callback:** The `KTerm_Update(term)` function checks if there is data in the response buffer. If so, it invokes the `ResponseCallback` function pointer, passing the buffered data to the host application. It is the host application's responsibility to set this callback and handle the data (e.g., by sending it over a serial or network connection).

#### 1.3.7. Session Management (Multiplexer)

Version 2.2 transforms the library into a tiling multiplexer.

-   **Sessions:** Independent `KTermSession` contexts (up to 4) maintain their own state (screen, history, cursor).
-   **Layout Tree:** The screen is divided into non-overlapping rectangles using a recursive `KTermPane` tree structure. Splits can be Horizontal or Vertical.
-   **Input Routing:** User input (Keyboard/Mouse) is routed exclusively to the session in the `focused_pane`.
-   **Background Processing:** All sessions, visible or not, continue to process data from their input pipelines and update their internal buffers.
-   **Reflow:** When a pane is resized, the session within it automatically reflows its text buffer to fit the new dimensions, preserving history.

## 2. Compliance and Emulation Levels

The library's behavior can be tailored to match historical and modern terminal standards by setting a compliance level. This is managed through a "logic grid" that explicitly defines which features are available at each level. This approach ensures that emulation is accurate, predictable, and easy to maintain.

### 2.1. The `VTFeatures` Logic Grid

At the core of the compliance system is the `VTFeatures` struct, a collection of boolean flags, where each flag represents a specific terminal capability (e.g., `sixel_graphics`, `true_color`, `mouse_tracking`).

The `KTerm_SetLevel()` function works by looking up the requested level in a static `vt_feature_grid` array. This array acts as the logic grid, containing a pre-defined `VTFeatures` configuration for every supported `VTLevel`. When a level is set, the corresponding feature set is copied into the active `terminal.conformance.features` struct, instantly enabling or disabling dozens of features to match the target standard. This also updates the device attribute strings that the terminal reports to the host. Additionally, setting the level automatically updates the **Answerback** string (e.g., "ANSI.SYS" for `VT_LEVEL_ANSI_SYS`, "kterm xterm" for `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`).

### 2.2. Feature Breakdown by `VTLevel`

This section details the key features enabled at each `VTLevel`. The `VTLevel` enum now uses semantic numbering (e.g., `VT_LEVEL_100 = 100`) to avoid breaking changes. The logic grid ensures that higher levels inherit features from lower ones.

| Level | Key Features Added |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`VT_LEVEL_52`** | Basic cursor movement (`ESC A/B/C/D`), direct cursor addressing, simple erase commands, alternate keypad mode. Emulates the DEC VT52. |

## 3. Control and Escape Sequences

The terminal's behavior is controlled by a stream of characters, including printable text and non-printable control sequences.

### 3.1. C0 Control Codes

These are single-byte codes in the range `0x00-0x1F`.

| Code | Hex | Name | Description                                                  |

### 3.2. C1 Control Codes (7-bit and 8-bit)

In a 7-bit environment, C1 codes (`0x80-0x9F`) are represented by `ESC` followed by a character in the range `0x40-0x5F`. The library primarily uses the 7-bit form.

| Sequence | Name | Description                                           |
| :------- | :--- | :---------------------------------------------------- |

### 3.3. CSI - Control Sequence Introducer (`ESC [`)

CSI sequences are the most common type of control sequence. They follow the format `CSI [private] [params] [intermediate] final`.

-   **Private Marker (`?`)**: A `?` after the `[` indicates a DEC Private Mode sequence.
-   **Parameters (`Pn`)**: A series of semicolon-separated numbers (e.g., `1;5`). Default is 1 or 0 depending on context.
-   **Intermediate Bytes**: Characters in the range `0x20-0x2F` (e.g., ` ` (space), `$`, `"`).
-   **Final Byte**: A character in the range `0x40-0x7E`.

### 3.5. DCS - Device Control String (`ESC P`)

DCS sequences are for device-specific commands, often with complex data payloads. They are terminated by `ST` (`ESC \`).

| Introduction | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DCS 1;1\|... ST` | `DECUDK` | **Program User-Defined Keys.** The payload `...` is a list of `key/hex_string` pairs separated by semicolons, where `key` is the keycode and `hex_string` is the hexadecimal representation of the string it should send. Requires VT320+ mode. When a key with a user-defined sequence is pressed, the terminal's keyboard handler (`KTerm_UpdateKeyboard`) will prioritize this sequence, sending it to the host instead of the key's default behavior. |
| `DCS 0;1\|... ST` | `DECUDK` | **Clear User-Defined Keys.** |
| `DCS 2;1\|... ST` | `DECDLD` | **Download Soft Font.** (Partially Implemented). Downloads custom character glyphs into the terminal's memory. Requires VT220+ mode. |
| `DCS $q... ST` | `DECRQSS` | **Request Status String.** The payload `...` is a name representing the setting to be queried (e.g., `m` for SGR, `r` for scrolling region). The terminal responds with another DCS sequence. |
| `DCS +q... ST` | `XTGETTCAP` | **Request Termcap/Terminfo String.** An xterm feature to query termcap capabilities like `Co` (colors) or `lines`. |
| `DCS Pq... ST`| `SIXEL` | **Sixel Graphics.** The payload contains Sixel image data to be rendered on the screen. The parser correctly handles raster attributes, color selection, repeats, and positioning. Requires VT320+ mode. |
| `DCS GATE... ST`| `GATEWAY` | **Gateway Protocol.** Allows the host to communicate with the embedding application. Format: `DCS GATE <Class>;<ID>;<Command>[;<Params>] ST`. |

| `ESC >` | `DECKPNM` | **Keypad Numeric Mode.** Sets the numeric keypad to send numeric characters. |
| `ESC (` C | `SCS` | **Select G0 Character Set.** Designates character set `C` (e.g., `B` for ASCII, `0` for DEC Special Graphics) to the G0 slot. |
| `ESC )` C | `SCS` | **Select G1 Character Set.** Designates a character set to the G1 slot. |
| `ESC *` C | `SCS` | **Select G2 Character Set.** Designates a character set to the G2 slot. |

## 4. Key Features In-Depth

### 4.1. Color Support

The library supports three color modes, selected via SGR sequences:

1.  **ANSI 16-color:** SGR codes `30-37`, `40-47`, `90-97`, `100-107`. The exact appearance is determined by the `ansi_colors` array.
2.  **256-color:** `CSI 38;5;Pn m` (foreground) and `CSI 48;5;Pn m` (background). The 256-color palette is a standard xterm palette.
3.  **True Color (24-bit):** `CSI 38;2;R;G;B m` (foreground) and `CSI 48;2;R;G;B m` (background).

### 4.2. Mouse Tracking

Mouse tracking must be enabled by the host application sending the appropriate CSI sequence. When enabled, mouse events are translated into byte sequences and sent to the host via the `ResponseCallback`.

-   **Modes:**
    -   `X10`: Basic button press reporting.
    -   `VT200`: Reports on both button press and release.
    -   `Button-Event`: Reports press, release, and motion while a button is held.
    -   `Any-Event`: Reports all mouse events, including motion.
    -   `SGR`: A modern, more robust protocol that supports higher-resolution coordinates and more modifier keys.
-   **Enabling:** Use `CSI ?{mode} h` (e.g., `CSI ?1003 h` for Any-Event tracking).
-   **Focus Reporting:** `CSI ?1004 h` enables reporting of window focus gain/loss events (`CSI I` and `CSI O`).

### 4.3. Character Sets

The terminal supports multiple character sets (G0-G3) and can map them to the active GL (left) and GR (right) slots.

-   **`ESC ( C`**: Designates character set `C` to G0.
-   **`ESC ) C`**: Designates character set `C` to G1.
-   **`SO` (`^N`) / `SI` (`^O`)**: Switch between G0 and G1 for the active GL set.
-   **Supported Sets (`C`):**
    -   `B`: US ASCII (Default)
    -   `A`: UK National
    -   `0`: DEC Special Graphics & Line Drawing
    -   `<`: DEC Multinational Character Set (MCS)

### 4.4. Screen and Buffer Management

-   **Alternate Screen Buffer:** Enabled with `CSI ?1049 h`. This saves the current screen state, clears the screen, and switches to a new buffer. `CSI ?1049 l` restores the original screen. This is commonly used by full-screen applications like `vim` or `less`.
-   **Scrolling Region:** `CSI Pt;Pb r` confines scrolling operations to the lines between `Pt` and `Pb`.
-   **Margins:** `CSI ? Pl;Pr s` confines the cursor to the columns between `Pl` and `Pr`. Requires Mode 69 (`DECLRMM`).

### 4.5. Sixel Graphics

Sixel is a bitmap graphics format designed for terminals, allowing for the display of raster images directly in the character grid. The library provides robust support for parsing and rendering Sixel data, enabling applications to display complex images and figures.

-   **Sequence:** The Sixel data stream is initiated with a Device Control String (DCS) sequence, typically of the form `DCS P1;P2;P3 q <sixel_data> ST`. The parameters `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` control aspects like the background color policy and horizontal grid size. The sequence is terminated by the String Terminator (`ST`).
-   **Enabling:** VT340+ recommended, available from `VT_LEVEL_320` in this library (including `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`).
-   **Functionality:** The internal Sixel parser (`KTerm_ProcessSixelChar`) processes the data stream character by character. It correctly interprets:
    -   **Raster Attributes (`"`)**: To define image geometry.
    -   **Color Introducers (`#`)**: To select from the active 256-color palette. Note: Mode `?1070` can be used to enable a private palette for Sixel/ReGIS.
    -   **Repeat Introducers (`!`)**: To efficiently encode runs of identical sixel data.
    -   **Carriage Return (`$`) and New Line (`-`)**: For positioning the sixel "cursor".
    -   **Sixel Data Characters (`?`-`~`)**: Each character encodes a 6-pixel vertical strip.
-   **Scrolling:** Controlled by `DECSDM` (Mode 80). If enabled (`?80h`), images that exceed the bottom margin are discarded (no scroll). If disabled (`?80l`), the screen scrolls to accommodate the image.
-   **Cursor Placement:** Controlled by Mode 8452. If enabled, the cursor is placed at the end of the graphic. If disabled (default), it moves to the next line.
-   **Rendering:** The parsed Sixel data is written into a pixel buffer (`terminal.sixel.data`). This buffer is uploaded to a GPU texture (`sixel_texture`) and composited over the text grid by the compute shader.
-   **Termination:** The Sixel parser correctly handles the `ST` (`ESC \`) sequence to terminate the Sixel data stream and return to the normal parsing state.

### 4.6. Bracketed Paste Mode

-   **Sequence:** `CSI ?2004 h`
-   **Functionality:** When enabled, pasted text is bracketed by `CSI 200~` and `CSI 201~`. This allows the host application to distinguish between typed and pasted text, preventing accidental execution of commands within the pasted content.

### 4.7. Session Management

v2.2 implements a true tiling multiplexer, moving beyond simple split-screen.

-   **Independent State:** Each session maintains its own screen buffer (with scrollback), cursor, modes, input pipeline, and parser state.
-   **Panes:** Sessions are displayed in "Panes". The screen is divided into non-overlapping rectangles using a recursive `KTermPane` tree structure. Splits can be Horizontal or Vertical.
    -   **API:** `KTerm_SplitPane(target, type, ratio)` allows dynamic subdivision of the screen.
-   **Focus:** Input is directed to the `focused_pane`.
    -   **API:** `KTerm_SetActiveSession(index)` or modifying `term->focused_pane` changes focus.
    -   **Cursor:** Only the focused pane renders the active hardware cursor. Other panes may show a hollow "inactive" cursor.
-   **Reflow:** When a pane is resized, the session within it automatically reflows its text buffer to fit the new dimensions, preserving as much scrollback history as possible (trimming excess from the top).
-   **Background Processing:** All sessions, visible or not, continue to process data from their input pipelines, update timers, and manage state in the background.
-   **Keybindings:** The multiplexer features an input interceptor (Prefix: `Ctrl+B`):
    -   `%`: Split vertically (Left/Right).
    -   `"`: Split horizontally (Top/Bottom).
    -   `o` / `n`: Cycle focus to the next pane.
    -   `x`: Close current pane (Planned).
-   **VT520 Compatibility:** The multiplexer still honors legacy VT520 commands like `DECSN` (Select Session) and `DECSSDT` (Split Definition) by mapping them to the new layout engine.

### 4.8. I/O Architecture Principle

The terminal operates on a strict **Single I/O Path** principle to ensure security and predictability.

1.  **Single Input Path:** The emulation engine is fed exclusively through the `Input Pipeline` via `KTerm_WriteChar`. Even local echo is typically handled by the host echoing characters back into this pipeline.
2.  **Single Output Path:** All communication to the host—whether it is user input (keystrokes) or device reports (DA/DSR)—is aggregated into the `Response Queue` and delivered via the single `ResponseCallback`.
3.  **Input Transformation:** Physical hardware events are intercepted by the Adapter, immediately transformed into standard Escape Sequences, and routed to the Output Path. They do not directly manipulate the emulation state.

### 4.9. Retro Visual Effects

To mimic the look of classic CRT terminals, the rendering engine includes configurable visual effects:

-   **Curvature:** `terminal.visual_effects.curvature` controls the barrel distortion of the screen.
-   **Scanlines:** `terminal.visual_effects.scanline_intensity` adds horizontal scanline darkening patterns.
-   These are applied in the Compute Shader (`TERMINAL_COMPUTE_SHADER_SRC`) during the final composition step.

### 4.10. ReGIS Graphics

ReGIS (Remote Graphics Instruction Set) is a vector graphics protocol used by DEC terminals. `kterm.h` provides a complete implementation of ReGIS, allowing host applications to draw complex shapes, lines, and text using a specialized command language.

-   **Sequence:** ReGIS commands are encapsulated in a DCS sequence: `DCS p ... ST` (or `ESC P p ... ESC \`).
-   **Supported Commands:**
    -   `P`: **Position**. Moves the graphics cursor.
    -   `V`: **Vector**. Draws lines.
    -   `C`: **Curve**. Draws circles, arcs, and interpolated B-splines.
    -   `T`: **Text**. Draws text strings with configurable size and rotation.
    -   `W`: **Write Control**. Sets writing modes (overlay, replace, erase, complement/XOR) and foreground color.
    -   `S`: **Screen Control**. Clears the screen.
    -   `L`: **Load Alphabet**. Defines custom character patterns for ReGIS text.
    -   `@`: **Macrographs**. Defines and executes macros (sequences of ReGIS commands).
    -   `F`: **Polygon Fill**. Fills arbitrary shapes.
-   **Architecture:** ReGIS rendering is handled by a dedicated "Vector Engine" compute shader. Vector instructions are accumulated into a buffer and rendered as an overlay on top of the text layer.
-   **Enabling:** Enabled for `VT_LEVEL_340`, `VT_LEVEL_525`, and `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`.

### 4.11. Gateway Protocol

The Gateway Protocol is a custom mechanism allowing the host system (e.g., a shell script or backend service) to send structured commands to the application embedding `kterm.h`. This is useful for integrating the terminal with external UI elements, resource managers, or custom hardware.

-   **Sequence:** `DCS GATE <Class> ; <ID> ; <Command> [ ; <Params> ] ST`
-   **Mechanism:** When the terminal parses this sequence, it invokes the user-registered `GatewayCallback`.
-   **Parsing:** The payload is tokenized by semicolons.
    -   `Class`: Category of the command (e.g., "UI", "AUDIO", "MAT").
    -   `ID`: Target object identifier.
    -   `Command`: The action to perform (e.g., "PLAY", "SET").
    -   `Params`: Optional parameters for the command.
-   **Example:** `\033PGATE;AUDIO;BGM;PLAY;TRACK1\033\` might tell a game engine to play a music track.

**Internal Commands (KTERM Class):**
The class ID `KTERM` is reserved for internal configuration.

| Command | Params | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SET;LEVEL` | `<Level>` | Sets VT emulation level (e.g., `100`, `525`, `1000` for XTERM, `1003` for ANSI.SYS). |

| `SET;CONCEAL`| `<Value>` | Sets the character code (0-255 or unicode) to display when the **Conceal** (Hidden) attribute is active. Default is `0` (hide text). Setting a value > 0 (e.g., `42` for `*`) renders that character instead. |
| `PIPE;BANNER`| `[Params]` | Injects a large ASCII-art banner into the input pipeline. Supports two formats:<br>1. **Legacy:** `<Mode>;<Text>` where `<Mode>` is `FIXED` or `KERNED`.<br>2. **Extended:** Key-Value pairs separated by semicolons.<br>- `TEXT=...`: The content to render.<br>- `FONT=...`: Font name (e.g., `VCR`, `IBM`). Uses default if omitted.<br>- `ALIGN=...`: Alignment (`LEFT`, `CENTER`, `RIGHT`).<br>- `GRADIENT=Start|End`: Applies RGB gradient (e.g., `#FF0000|#0000FF`).<br>- `MODE=...`: Spacing mode (`FIXED` or `KERNED`). |

### 4.12. Kitty Graphics Protocol

v2.2 adds full support for the Kitty Graphics Protocol, a modern standard for displaying high-performance raster graphics in the terminal.

-   **Mechanism:** Uses APC sequences: `ESC _ G [key=value;...] <payload> ST`.
-   **Features Supported:**
    -   **Transmission:** `a=t` (Transmit), `a=T` (Transmit & Display), `a=q` (Query), `a=p` (Place). Supports direct (RGB/RGBA) and Base64-encoded payloads.
    -   **Chunking:** Handles chunked transmission (`m=1`) for large images.
    -   **Placement:** Detailed control over `x`, `y` position (relative to cell or window) and `z-index`.
    -   **Z-Ordering:**
        -   `z < 0`: Drawn in the background (behind text). Transparency in the text layer (default background color) allows these to show through.
        -   `z >= 0`: Drawn in the foreground (over text).
    -   **Animation:** Fully supports multi-frame animations (`a=f`) with configurable frame delays (`z` parameter).
    -   **Composition:** Images are composited using a dedicated `texture_blit.comp` compute shader, ensuring correct alpha blending and clipping to the specific split-pane they belong to.
    -   **Memory Safety:** Enforces strict VRAM limits (default 64MB) per session to prevent denial-of-service attacks via graphics spam.
    -   **Delete/Clear:** Supports `a=d` (Delete) command with various actions (e.g., `d=a` for all, `d=i` by ID, `d=p` by placement).

### 4.13. IBM PC / DOS Compatibility Mode

**v2.2.2** introduces a dedicated emulation mode for running legacy DOS applications (e.g., via DOSEMU or remote connection). This mode is activated by setting the compliance level to `VT_LEVEL_ANSI_SYS` (1003).

*   **ANSI.SYS Emulation:** Implements the behavior of the standard MS-DOS `ANSI.SYS` driver.
    *   **Cursor Save/Restore:** Maps standard ANSI `CSI s` and `CSI u` to Save/Restore Cursor (overriding typical DEC usage).
    *   **Line Wrap:** Enforces "Standard Mode 7" (Line Wrap) by default.
    *   **Device Attributes:** Suppresses DA responses to prevents confusion in non-VT aware apps.
*   **Visual Authenticity:**
    *   **CGA Palette:** Enforces the authentic 16-color IBM CGA palette (e.g., Brown `0xAA5500` instead of Yellow).
    *   **IBM Font:** Automatically switches the terminal font to the internal "IBM" raster font (Code Page 437) for correct box-drawing characters.

### 4.14. Dynamic Font Switching & Glyph Centering

**v2.2.1** introduces a dynamic font management system allowing runtime switching between internal fonts.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **API:** `KTerm_SetFont(term, "Name")`.
    *   **Gateway Protocol:** `SET;FONT;Name`.
    *   **OSC 50:** `ESC ] 50 ; Name ST`.
*   **Centering:** The renderer automatically calculates centering offsets. If a font's glyph data (e.g., 8x8) is smaller than the terminal cell size (e.g., 9x16), the glyph is perfectly centered within the cell.
*   **Supported Fonts:** Includes "DEC" (VT220 8x10), "IBM" (VGA 9x16), and any TrueType font loaded via `KTerm_LoadFont`.

### 4.15. Printer Controller Mode

The library supports the DEC Printer Controller Mode (or Media Copy), allowing the host to send data directly to an attached printer (or callback function) without displaying it on the screen.

*   **Enable:** `CSI 5 i` (Auto Print) or `CSI ? 5 i` (Printer Controller).
*   **Disable:** `CSI 4 i` or `CSI ? 4 i`.
*   **Print Form Feed (Mode 18):** When `DECPFF` (`CSI ? 18 h`) is enabled, a Form Feed character (0x0C) is appended to the data stream after a screen print operation.
*   **Print Extent (Mode 19):** Controls the scope of the `Print Screen` (`CSI i`) command.
    *   `DECPEX` Enabled (`CSI ? 19 h`): Prints the full screen.
    *   `DECPEX` Disabled (`CSI ? 19 l`): Prints only the scrolling region.
*   **Callback:** Data is routed to the user-registered `PrinterCallback`.

### 4.16. Rich Text Attributes (Extended SGR)

KTerm supports extended SGR attributes for advanced text styling, including multiple underline styles and colors.

*   **Underline Styles (SGR 4:x):**
    *   `4:1`: Single Underline
    *   `4:2`: Double Underline
    *   `4:3`: Curly Underline (Wave)
    *   `4:4`: Dotted Underline
    *   `4:5`: Dashed Underline
*   **Attribute Colors (SGR 58/59):**
    *   `58;5;Pn`: Set Underline Color (Indexed)
    *   `58;2;R;G;B`: Set Underline Color (TrueColor)
    *   `59`: Reset Underline Color to Default (Foreground)
*   **Strikethrough Color:** Accessible via the Gateway Protocol or API.

### 4.17. Tektronix 4010/4014 Emulation

KTerm includes full emulation of the Tektronix 4010 and 4014 vector graphics terminals.

*   **Entry:** `CSI ? 38 h` (DECTEK) switches the terminal into Tektronix mode.
*   **Exit:** `ESC \x03` (ETX) or similar mode reset sequences return to ANSI/VT mode.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Alpha Mode:** Text rendering.
    *   **Graph Mode:** Vector drawing logic using High/Low X/Y byte encoding.
    *   **GIN Mode:** Graphic Input (Crosshair cursor) reporting.
    *   **Vector Layer:** Renders to the same vector overlay used by ReGIS, ensuring consistent visual blending.

### 4.18. BiDirectional Text Support (BiDi)

KTerm implements basic BiDirectional text support via the `BDSM` (Bi-Directional Support Mode) private mode `8246`.

*   **Mechanism:** When enabled (`CSI ? 8246 h`), the terminal performs an internal "visual reordering" of text on a per-row basis before rendering.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Detects RTL characters (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic).
    *   Reverses RTL runs for correct display.
    *   Mirrors characters like parenthesis `()` and brackets `[]` within reversed runs.
*   **Limitation:** This is a simplified internal implementation (`BiDiReorderRow`) and does not currently use the full `fribidi` library for complex shaping or implicit paragraph direction handling.

### 4.19. DEC Locator Support

The DEC Locator (Mouse) input model provides an alternative to standard xterm mouse tracking, reporting rectangular coordinates and specific events.

*   **Enable:** `CSI ? 41 h` (`DECELR` - Enable Locator Reporting).
*   **Events:** Controlled by `DECSLE` (`CSI ? Ps {`). Can report button down, button up, or only on request.
*   **Request:** `DECRQLP` (`CSI Ps |`) allows the host to query the current locator position instantly.
*   **Status:** `CSI ? 53 n` reports locator availability.

-   `KTerm* KTerm_Create(KTermConfig config);`
    Allocates and initializes a new `KTerm` instance. `config` allows setting initial dimensions and callbacks.

-   `void KTerm_Destroy(KTerm* term);`
    Frees all resources allocated by the terminal instance. This includes the font texture, memory for programmable keys, and any other dynamically allocated buffers.

-   `void KTerm_Init(KTerm* term);`
    Initializes a pre-allocated `Terminal` struct to a default state. Called internally by `KTerm_Create`.

-   `void KTerm_Cleanup(KTerm* term);`
    Frees internal resources of a terminal instance. Called by `KTerm_Destroy`.

-   `void KTerm_Update(KTerm* term);`
    This is the main "tick" function for the terminal. It should be called once per frame. It drives all ongoing processes:
    -   Processes a batch of characters from the input pipeline.
    -   Updates internal timers for cursor and text blinking.
    -   Polls Situation for keyboard and mouse input and translates them into VT events.
    -   Invokes the `ResponseCallback` if any data is queued to be sent to the host.

-   `void KTerm_Draw(KTerm* term);`
    Renders the current state of the terminal to the screen. It iterates over the screen buffer, drawing each character with its correct attributes. It also handles drawing the cursor, Sixel graphics, and visual bell. Must be called within a Situation `BeginDrawing()` / `EndDrawing()` block.

## 6. Internal Operations and Data Flow

This chapter provides a deeper, narrative look into the internal mechanics of the library, tracing the journey of a single character from its arrival in the input pipeline to its final rendering on the screen.

### 6.1. Stage 1: Ingestion

1.  **Entry Point:** A host application calls `KTerm_WriteString("ESC[31mHello")`.
2.  **Buffering:** Each character of the string (`E`, `S`, `C`, `[`, `3`, `1`, `m`, `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`) is sequentially written into the `input_pipeline`, a large circular byte buffer. The `pipeline_head` index advances with each write.

### 6.2. Stage 2: Consumption and Parsing

1.  **The Tick:** The main `KTerm_Update()` function is called. It determines it has a processing budget to handle, for example, 200 characters.
2.  **Dequeuing:** `KTerm_ProcessEvents()` begins consuming characters from the `pipeline_tail`.
3.  **The State Machine in Action:** `KTerm_ProcessChar()` is called for each character:
    -   **`E`, `S`, `C`:** These are initially processed in the `VT_PARSE_NORMAL` state. Since they are regular printable characters, the terminal would normally just print them. However, the parser is about to hit the `ESC` character.
    -   **`ESC` (`0x1B`):** When `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar()` receives the Escape character, it does not print anything. Instead, it immediately changes the parser's state: `terminal.parse_state = VT_PARSE_ESCAPE;`.
    -   **`[`:** The next character is processed by `KTerm_ProcessEscapeChar()`. It sees `[` and knows this is a Control Sequence Introducer. It changes the state again: `terminal.parse_state = PARSE_CSI;` and clears the `escape_buffer`.
    -   **`3`, `1`, `m`:** Now `KTerm_ProcessCSIChar()` is being called.
        -   The characters `3` and `1` are numeric parameters. They are appended to the `escape_buffer`.
        -   The character `m` is a "final byte" (in the range `0x40`-`0x7E`). This terminates the sequence.
4.  **Execution:**
    -   `KTerm_ProcessCSIChar()` calls `KTerm_ParseCSIParams()` on the `escape_buffer` ("31"). This populates the `escape_params` array with the integer `31`.
    -   It then calls `KTerm_ExecuteCSICommand('m')`.
    -   The command dispatcher for `m` (`ExecuteSGR`) is invoked. `ExecuteSGR` iterates through its parameters. It sees `31`, which corresponds to setting the foreground color to ANSI red.
    -   It updates the *current terminal state* by changing `terminal.current_fg` to represent the color red. It does **not** yet change any character on the screen.
    -   Finally, the parser state is reset to `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`.

### 6.3. Stage 3: Character Processing and Screen Buffer Update

1.  **`H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`:** The parser is now back in `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`. `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar()` is called for each of these characters.
2.  **Placement:** For the character 'H':
    -   The function checks the cursor's current position (`terminal.cursor.x`, `terminal.cursor.y`).
    -   It retrieves the `EnhancedTermChar` struct at that position in the `screen` buffer.
    -   It sets that struct's `ch` field to `'H'`.
    -   Crucially, it copies the *current* terminal attributes into the cell's attributes: `cell->fg_color` gets the value of `terminal.current_fg` (which we just set to red).
    -   The `dirty` flag for this cell is set to `true`.
    -   The cursor's X position is incremented: `terminal.cursor.x++`.
3.  This process repeats for 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', each time placing the character, applying the current SGR attributes (red foreground), and advancing the cursor.

### 6.4. Stage 4: Rendering (Compositor Loop)

1.  **Drawing Frame:** `KTerm_Draw()` is called.
2.  **Texture Blit (Background):** `KTerm_Draw` iterates through visible panes. For each session with `z < 0` Kitty images, it dispatches `texture_blit.comp` to draw them onto the `output_texture`. It sets a clipping rectangle via push constants to ensure images don't bleed into adjacent panes.
3.  **SSBO Update:** `KTerm_UpdateSSBO()` traverses the `layout_root` tree. For every visible cell on screen, it determines which session it belongs to, retrieves the `EnhancedTermChar`, packs it into `GPUCell`, and uploads it to the SSBO.
4.  **Compute Dispatch (Text):** The core `terminal.comp` shader is dispatched. It renders the character grid. Crucially, the "default background" color (index 0) is rendered as transparent (alpha=0), allowing the previously drawn background images to show through.
5.  **Texture Blit (Foreground):** A second pass of `texture_blit.comp` draws Sixel graphics and `z >= 0` Kitty images over the text.
6.  **Presentation:** The final `output_texture` is presented.

This entire cycle leverages the GPU for massive parallelism, ensuring the terminal remains responsive even at high resolutions.

### 6.5. Stage 5: Keyboard Input Processing

Concurrent to the host-to-terminal data flow, the library handles user input from the physical keyboard and mouse, translating it into byte sequences that a host application can understand.

1.  **Polling:** In each frame, `KTerm_Update()` calls `KTerm_UpdateKeyboard()`. This function polls Situation for any key presses, releases, or character inputs.
2.  **Event Creation:** For each input, a `VTKeyEvent` struct is created, capturing the raw key code, modifier states (Ctrl, Alt, Shift), and a timestamp.
3.  **Sequence Generation:** The core of the translation happens in `KTerm_GenerateVTSequence()`. This function takes a `VTKeyEvent` and populates its `sequence` field based on a series of rules:
    -   **Control Keys:** `Ctrl+A` is translated to `0x01`, `Ctrl+[` to `ESC`, etc.
    -   **Application Modes:** It checks `terminal.vt_keyboard.cursor_key_mode` (DECCKM) and `terminal.vt_keyboard.keypad_mode` (DECKPAM). If these modes are active, it generates application-specific sequences (e.g., `ESC O A` for the up arrow) instead of the default ANSI sequences (`ESC [ A`).
    -   **Meta Key:** If `terminal.vt_keyboard.meta_sends_escape` is true, pressing `Alt` in combination with another key will prefix that key's character with an `ESC` byte.
    -   **Normal Characters:** Standard printable characters are typically encoded as UTF-8.
4.  **Buffering:** The processed `VTKeyEvent`, now containing the final byte sequence, is placed into the `vt_keyboard.buffer`, a circular event buffer.
5.  **Host Retrieval (API):** The host application integrating the library is expected to call `KTerm_GetKey()` in its main loop. This function dequeues the next event from the buffer, providing the host with the translated sequence.
6.  **Host Transmission (Callback):** The typical application pattern is to take the sequence received from `KTerm_GetKey()` and send it immediately back to the PTY or remote connection that the terminal is displaying. This is often done via the `ResponseCallback` mechanism. For local echo, the same sequence can also be written back into the terminal's *input* pipeline to be displayed on screen.

This clear separation of input (`input_pipeline`) and output (`vt_keyboard.buffer` -> `ResponseCallback`) ensures that the terminal acts as a proper two-way communication device, faithfully translating between user actions and the byte streams expected by terminal-aware applications.

-   `bool origin_mode`: `DECOM` state. If `true`, the home cursor position and absolute cursor movements are relative to the top-left corner of the scrolling region, not the screen.
-   `bool auto_wrap_mode`: `DECAWM` state. If `true`, the cursor automatically wraps to the beginning of the next line upon reaching the right margin.
-   `bool alternate_screen`: Tracks if the alternate screen buffer is currently active, as set by `CSI ?1049 h`.
-   `bool insert_mode`: `IRM` state. If `true`, new characters typed at the cursor shift existing characters to the right instead of overwriting them.
-   `bool new_line_mode`: `LNM` state. If `true`, a line feed (`LF`) operation is treated as a `CRLF`, moving the cursor to the beginning of the new line.
-   `bool column_mode_132`: `DECCOLM` state. Tracks if the terminal is logically in 132-column mode.
-   `bool reverse_video`: `DECSCNM` state. If `true`, the entire screen's foreground and background colors are globally swapped during rendering.

#### 7.2.8. `VTKeyEvent`

A structure containing a fully processed keyboard event, ready to be sent back to the host application.

-   `int key_code`: The original Situation key code or Unicode character code that generated the event.
-   `bool ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `meta`: The state of the modifier keys at the time of the press.
-   `char sequence[32]`: The final, translated byte sequence to be sent to the host (e.g., `"A"`, `"\x1B[A"`, or `"\x01"` for Ctrl+A).

#### 7.2.9. `CharsetState`
-   `CharacterSet g0, g1, g2, g3`: Stores which character set is designated to each of the four "G-set" slots.
-   `CharacterSet *gl, *gr`: Pointers that determine the active "left" (GL) and "right" (GR) character sets. For 7-bit terminals, characters are typically interpreted from the GL set.
-   `bool single_shift_2`, `single_shift_3`: Flags that are set by `SS2` (`ESC N`) and `SS3` (`ESC O`). When set, they indicate that the *very next* character should be interpreted from the G2 or G3 set, respectively, for a single character lookup.

#### 7.2.10. `KittyGraphics` and `KittyImageBuffer`

Manages state for the Kitty Graphics Protocol.

-   `KittyImageBuffer* images`: Array of stored images for a session.
    -   `uint32_t id`: Image ID.
    -   `int x, y`: Placement coordinates.
    -   `int z_index`: Z-ordering.
    -   `bool visible`, `bool complete`: Visibility and upload status.
    -   `KittyFrame* frames`: Array of animation frames.
    -   `int current_frame`: Current frame being displayed.
    -   `double frame_timer`: Animation timer.

## 8. Configuration Constants

These `#define` constants, located at the top of `kterm.h`, allow for compile-time configuration of the terminal's default behaviors and resource limits. To change them, you must define them *before* the `#include "kterm.h"` line where `KTERM_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined.

| Constant | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DEFAULT_TERM_WIDTH` | `132` | Sets the default width of the terminal screen in character cells. This is the value used on initial startup. |
| `DEFAULT_TERM_HEIGHT`| `50` | Sets the default height of the terminal screen in character cells. |
| `DEFAULT_CHAR_WIDTH` | `8` | The width in pixels of a single character glyph in the bitmap font. This value is tied to the included `font_data.h`. |
| `DEFAULT_CHAR_HEIGHT`| `16` | The height in pixels of a single character glyph. Also tied to the font data. |
| `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SCALE`| `1` | A scaling factor applied to the window size and font rendering. A value of `2` would create a 2x scaled window. |
| `MAX_ESCAPE_PARAMS` | `32` | The maximum number of numeric parameters that can be parsed from a single CSI sequence (e.g., `CSI Pn;Pn;...;Pn m`). Increasing this allows for more complex SGR sequences but uses more memory. |
| `MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER`| `512` | The size of the buffer used to temporarily store incoming escape sequences (CSI, OSC, DCS, etc.) during parsing. If you expect very long OSC title strings or DCS payloads, you may need to increase this. |
| `MAX_TAB_STOPS` | `256` | The maximum number of columns for which tab stops can be set. This should be greater than or equal to `DEFAULT_TERM_WIDTH`. |
| `MAX_TITLE_LENGTH` | `256` | The maximum length of the window and icon titles that can be set via OSC sequences. |
| `KEY_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE`| `65536`| The size of the circular buffer for queuing processed keyboard events before they are sent to the host. A larger buffer can handle rapid typing without dropping events. |
| `KTERM_INPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE` | `1048576`| The size of the input buffer (1MB) used to receive data from the host application. A large buffer is crucial for high-throughput graphics protocols like Sixel and Kitty. |
| `KTERM_OUTPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE` | `16384`| The size of the buffer used to queue responses (keyboard input, mouse events, status reports) to be sent back to the host application via the `ResponseCallback`. |
