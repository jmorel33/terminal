## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Description

K-Term is a comprehensive C library for terminal emulation, designed with a modular architecture for easy integration. The library is organized into three files:

- **`kterm_api.h`**: Public API declarations (types, structs, function prototypes)
- **`kterm_impl.h`**: Core implementation code
- **`kterm.h`**: Implementation orchestrator that coordinates all modules when `KTERM_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined

When `KTERM_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined, `kterm.h` includes implementations in the following order:
1. Font data (font_data.h)
2. Parser module (kt_parser.h)
3. Layout module (kt_layout.h)
4. Core implementation (kterm_impl.h)
5. Gateway module (kt_gateway.h) - if KTERM_ENABLE_GATEWAY is defined
6. Networking module (kt_net.h) - unless KTERM_DISABLE_NET is defined
7. Compositor module (kt_composite_sit.h)

The library is designed for integration into applications requiring a text-based user interface, such as embedded systems, remote access clients, or development tools. It uses [Situation](https://github.com/jmorel33/situation) for rendering, windowing, and input handling, providing a complete solution out of the box.

The library emulates a wide range of historical and modern terminal standards, from the DEC VT52 to contemporary xterm extensions. It processes a stream of bytes, interprets control codes and escape sequences, and maintains an internal model of the terminal screen, which is then rendered to the display.

### 1.3. Known Limitations (v2.6.23)

While K-Term is production-ready, users should be aware of the following limitations in the v2.6.23 release:

1.  **BiDirectional Text (BiDi):**
    -   Support is currently limited to an internal visual reordering algorithm (`BiDiReorderRow`).
    -   It lacks full `fribidi` parity for complex text shaping and implicit paragraph direction handling.
    -   This may affect rendering accuracy for Right-to-Left languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew) in complex contexts.

2.  **SSH Security Modes:**
    -   The `ssh_client.c` reference implementation supports two modes:
        -   **Production (Recommended):** Compiling with `KTERM_USE_LIBSSH` links against `libssh`, providing industry-standard security (encryption, authentication, key exchange).
        -   **Reference/Mock (Default):** Without this macro, it uses internal mock cryptographic primitives for testing and education. **This mode is not secure.**

3.  **Unicode Coverage:**
    -   Glyph rendering relies on the `stb_truetype` rasterizer. While it supports the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), specialized rendering for complex scripts (Devanagari, etc.) beyond basic shaping is not yet fully implemented.

### 1.4. Architectural Deep Dive

This section provides a more detailed examination of the library's internal components and data flow, expanding on the brief overview. Understanding this architecture is key to extending the library or diagnosing complex emulation issues.

#### 1.4.1. Core Philosophy and The `KTerm` Struct

The library's design is centered on a single, comprehensive data structure: the `KTerm` struct. This monolithic struct, defined in `kterm.h`, encapsulates the entire state of the emulated device.

In **v2.4**, `KTerm` acts as a thread-safe hypervisor/multiplexer. Instead of managing a single state, it holds:
-   An array of `KTermSession` structs (up to `MAX_SESSIONS`), each representing a virtual terminal with its own screen buffer, cursor, parser state, and **mutex lock**.
-   A `KTermLayout` containing the `KTermPane` tree, defining how these sessions are tiled on the screen.
-   Global resources like the GPU pipeline, font texture, and shared input/output buffers.

The API remains **instance-based** (`KTerm*`), allowing multiple independent multiplexer instances to coexist.

#### 1.4.2. The Input Pipeline

The terminal is a consumer of sequential character data. The entry point for all incoming data from a host application (e.g., a shell, a remote server) is the input pipeline.

-   **Mechanism:** A fixed-size circular buffer (`input_pipeline`) of `unsigned char`.
-   **Ingestion:** Host applications use `KTerm_WriteChar(term, ...)`, `KTerm_WriteString(term, ...)` to append data to this buffer. These functions are intended for use from the main application thread.
-   **Flow Control:** The pipeline has a fixed size (`16384` bytes). If the host writes data faster than the terminal can process it, an overflow flag (`pipeline_overflow`) is set. This allows the host application to detect the overflow and potentially pause data transmission.

#### 1.4.3. The Processing Loop and State Machine

The heart of the emulation is the main processing loop within `KTerm_Update(term)`, which drives a sophisticated state machine.

-   **Consumption:** `KTerm_Update(term)` iterates through all active sessions and consumes a tunable number of characters from each session's input pipeline via `KTerm_ProcessEventsInternal()`. This prevents the emulation from freezing the application when large amounts of data are received. The number of characters processed can be adjusted for performance (`VTperformance` struct).
-   **Parsing:** Each character is fed into `KTerm_ProcessChar()`, which acts as a dispatcher based on the current `VTParseState`.
    -   `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`: In the default state, printable characters are sent to the screen, and control characters (like `ESC` or C0 codes) change the parser's state.
    -   `VT_PARSE_ESCAPE`: After an `ESC` (`0x1B`) is received, the parser enters this state, waiting for the next character to determine the type of sequence (e.g., `[` for CSI, `]` for OSC).
    -   `PARSE_CSI`, `PARSE_OSC`, `PARSE_DCS`, etc.: In these states, the parser accumulates parameters and intermediate bytes into `escape_buffer` until a final character (terminator) is received.
    -   **Execution:** Once a sequence is complete, a corresponding `Execute...()` function is called (e.g., `KTerm_ExecuteCSICommand`, `KTerm_ExecuteOSCCommand`).
    -   **Deferred Operations:** Unlike previous versions, execution does **not** modify the grid directly. Instead, it queues a `KTermOp` (Operation) into the session's **Op Queue**. This ensures atomicity and thread safety.

#### 1.4.4. The Screen Buffer

The visual state of the terminal is stored in one of two screen buffers, both of which are 2D arrays of `EnhancedTermChar`.

   **`EnhancedTermChar`:** This crucial struct represents a single character cell on the screen. It goes far beyond a simple `char`, storing:
    -   The Unicode codepoint (`ch`).
    -   Foreground and background colors (`ExtendedColor`), which can be an indexed palette color or a 24-bit RGB color.
    -   A comprehensive set of boolean flags for attributes like `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `blink`, `reverse`, `strikethrough`, `conceal`, and more.
    -   Flags for DEC special modes like double-width or double-height characters (currently unsupported).
-   **Primary vs. Alternate Buffer:** The terminal maintains `screen` and `alt_screen`. Applications like `vim` or `less` switch to the alternate buffer (`CSI ?1049 h`) to create a temporary full-screen interface. When they exit, they switch back (`CSI ?1049 l`), restoring the original screen content and scrollback.

#### 1.4.5. The Rendering Engine (The Compositor)

The v2.4 rendering engine operates as a decoupled, thread-safe **Compositor**. The Logic Thread prepares a double-buffered `KTermRenderBuffer`, while the Render Thread consumes it. The `KTerm_Draw()` function orchestrates a multi-pass GPU pipeline:

1.  **Layout Traversal:** It iterates through the `layout` tree (`KTermPane`) to calculate the absolute screen viewport for each visible leaf pane.
2.  **SSBO Update:** `RecursiveUpdateSSBO()` uploads content from each visible session into a global `GPUCell` staging buffer, respecting pane boundaries.
3.  **Compute Dispatch (Text):** The core `terminal.comp` shader renders the text grid for the entire screen in one pass.
4.  **Overlay Pass (Graphics):** A new `texture_blit.comp` pipeline is dispatched to draw media elements:
    -   **Sixel Graphics:** Rendered from a dedicated texture.
    -   **Kitty Graphics:** Images are composited with full Alpha Blending and Z-Index support (background images behind text, foreground images on top).
    -   **ReGIS/Vectors:** Vector graphics are drawn as an overlay layer.
5.  **Presentation:** The final composited image is presented to the screen.

#### 1.4.6. The Output Pipeline (Response System)

The terminal needs to send data back to the host in response to certain queries or events. This is handled by the output pipeline, or response system.

-   **Mechanism:** In v2.4.4, each `KTermSession` maintains its own lock-free **Response Ring Buffer** (`response_ring`). This ensures that responses from multiple sessions (e.g., background queries) are safely queued without contention or blocking.
-   **Events:** The following events generate responses:
    -   **User Input:** Keystrokes and mouse events queued via `KTerm_QueueInputEvent(term)` are translated into the appropriate VT sequences and queued for transmission.
    -   **Status Reports:** Commands like `DSR` (Device Status Report) or `DA` (Device Attributes) queue their predefined response strings.
-   **Sink (Modern):** Applications can register an `OutputSink` using `KTerm_SetOutputSink`. This flushes the ring buffer and subsequently bypasses it, delivering response data directly to the callback as it is generated (zero-copy). This is the preferred method for high-performance integration.

#### 1.4.7. Session Management (Multiplexer)

Version 2.4 decouples the tiling multiplexer into `kt_layout.h`.

-   **Sessions:** Independent `KTermSession` contexts (up to 4) maintain their own state (screen, history, cursor) and thread locks.
-   **Layout Tree:** The screen is divided into non-overlapping rectangles using a recursive `KTermPane` tree structure. Splits can be Horizontal or Vertical.
-   **Input Routing:** User input (Keyboard/Mouse) is routed exclusively to the session in the `focused_pane`.
-   **Reflow:** When a pane is resized, the session within it automatically reflows its text buffer to fit the new dimensions via `KTerm_ResizeSession`, preserving history.

## 2. Compliance and Emulation Levels

The library's behavior can be tailored to match historical and modern terminal standards by setting a compliance level. This is managed through a "logic grid" that explicitly defines which features are available at each level. This approach ensures that emulation is accurate, predictable, and easy to maintain.

### 2.1. The `VTFeatures` Logic Grid

At the core of the compliance system is the `VTFeatures` struct, a collection of boolean flags, where each flag represents a specific terminal capability (e.g., `sixel_graphics`, `true_color`, `mouse_tracking`).

The `KTerm_SetLevel()` function works by looking up the requested level in a static `vt_feature_grid` array. This array acts as the logic grid, containing a pre-defined `VTFeatures` configuration for every supported `VTLevel`. When a level is set, the corresponding feature set is copied into the active `terminal.conformance.features` struct, instantly enabling or disabling dozens of features to match the target standard. This also updates the device attribute strings that the terminal reports to the host. Additionally, setting the level automatically updates the **Answerback** string (e.g., "ANSI.SYS" for `VT_LEVEL_ANSI_SYS`, "kterm xterm" for `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`).

### 2.2. Feature Breakdown by `VTLevel`

This section details the key features enabled at each `VTLevel`. The `VTLevel` enum now uses semantic numbering (e.g., `VT_LEVEL_100 = 100`) to avoid breaking changes. The logic grid ensures that higher levels inherit features from lower ones.

| Level | Key Features Added |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`VT_LEVEL_52`** | Basic cursor movement (`ESC A/B/C/D`), direct cursor addressing, simple erase commands, alternate keypad mode. Emulates the DEC VT52. |
| **`VT_LEVEL_100`** | Introduces ANSI CSI sequences, SGR attributes (bold, underline, reverse), scrolling regions (`DECSTBM`), and DEC Special Graphics. |
| **`VT_LEVEL_102`** | Functionally identical to VT100 in this library. |
| **`VT_LEVEL_132`** | Functionally identical to VT102 in this library. |
| **`VT_LEVEL_220`** | 8-bit controls, soft fonts (`DECDLD`), User-Defined Keys (`DECUDK`). |
| **`VT_LEVEL_340`** | Sixel graphics (`DCS Pq...ST`). |
| **`VT_LEVEL_420`** | Rectangular area operations (`DECCRA`, `DECFRA`), selective erase (`DECSERA`), ANSI Text Locator (`DECSLE`, `DECRQLP`). |
| **`VT_LEVEL_510`** | Windowing support queries and PC-style function keys. |

| 8452 | `-`| **Sixel Cursor Mode.** `h` places cursor at end of graphic. `l` moves to next line. |


#### 3.3.4. Multi-Session & Split Screen
These commands control the VT520-style multi-session and split screen features. **Note:** In v2.2+, legacy VT520 session commands are mapped to the tiling layout engine (focus change instead of full session switch).

| Command | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CSI Ps ! ~` | `DECSN` | **Select Session Number.** Switches the active session to `Ps`. `Ps` is 1-based (1-3). |
| `CSI ? Ps n` | `DECRSN` | **Report Session Number.** If `Ps=12`, reports the active session as `CSI ? 12 ; {session} n`. |
| `CSI ? 21 n` | `DECRS` | **Report Session Status.** Reports availability of sessions via a DCS string. |
| `CSI Ps $ }` | `DECSASD`| **Select Active Status Display.** `Ps=0`: Main display. `Ps=1`: Status line. |
| `CSI Ps $ ~` | `DECSSDT`| **Select Split Definition Type.** `Ps=0`: No split. `Ps=1`: Horizontal split (50/50). |

### 3.4. OSC - Operating System Command (`ESC ]`)

OSC sequences are used for interacting with the host operating system or terminal window manager. The format is `ESC ] Ps ; Pt BEL` or `ESC ] Ps ; Pt ST`, where `Ps` is the command parameter and `Pt` is the command string.

| `Ps` | Command | `Pt` (Parameters) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Set Icon and Window Title | `string` | Sets both the window and icon titles to the given string. |
| 1 | Set Icon Title | `string` | Sets the icon title. |
| 2 | Set Window Title | `string` | Sets the main window title. |
| 4 | Set/Query Color Palette | `c;spec` | `c` is the color index (0-255). `spec` can be `?` to query, or `rgb:RR/GG/BB` to set. |
| 10 | Set/Query Foreground Color | `?` or `color`| Sets the default text color. `?` queries the current color. |
| 11 | Set/Query Background Color | `?` or `color`| Sets the default background color. `?` queries the current color. |
| 12 | Set/Query Cursor Color | `?` or `color`| Sets the text cursor color. `?` queries the current color. |
| 50 | Set Font | `font_spec` | Sets the terminal font to `font_spec`. This triggers the dynamic loading of the specified font file (e.g., a TTF) if it exists in the configured paths or internal registry. Queries (`?`) are currently ignored. |
| 52 | Clipboard Operations | `c;data` | `c` specifies the clipboard (`c` for clipboard, `p` for primary). `data` is the base64-encoded string to set, or `?` to query. (Query is a no-op). |
| 104| Reset Color Palette | `c1;c2;...` | Resets the specified color indices to their default values. If no parameters are given, resets the entire palette. |
| 110| Reset Foreground Color | (none) | Resets the default foreground color to the initial default. |
| 111| Reset Background Color | (none) | Resets the default background color to the initial default. |
| 112| Reset Cursor Color | (none) | Resets the cursor color to its initial default. |

### 3.5. DCS - Device Control String (`ESC P`)

DCS sequences are for device-specific commands, often with complex data payloads. They are terminated by `ST` (`ESC \`).

| Introduction | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DCS 1;1\|... ST` | `DECUDK` | **Program User-Defined Keys.** The payload `...` is a list of `key/hex_string` pairs separated by semicolons, where `key` is the keycode and `hex_string` is the hexadecimal representation of the string it should send. Requires VT320+ mode. When a key with a user-defined sequence is queued through `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()` or processed through `KTerm_ProcessEvent()`, the terminal prioritizes this sequence and sends it to the host instead of the key's default behavior. |
| `DCS 0;1\|... ST` | `DECUDK` | **Clear User-Defined Keys.** |
| `DCS 2;1\|... ST` | `DECDLD` | **Download Soft Font.** (Partially Implemented). Downloads custom character glyphs into the terminal's memory. Requires VT220+ mode. |
| `DCS $q... ST` | `DECRQSS` | **Request Status String.** Queries the status of a specific setting. The payload `...` is the setting to query:<br>- `m`: SGR (Select Graphic Rendition).<br>- `r`: DECSTBM (Scrolling Region).<br>- `s`: DECSLRM (Left/Right Margins).<br>- `t`: DECSLPP (Lines Per Page).<br>- `|`: DECSCPP (Columns Per Page).<br>- `q` or `state`: Gateway State Snapshot.<br>Response: `DCS 1 $ r <Response> ST`. |
| `DCS +q... ST` | `XTGETTCAP` | **Request Termcap/Terminfo String.** An xterm feature to query termcap capabilities like `Co` (colors) or `lines`. |
| `DCS Pq... ST`| `SIXEL` | **Sixel Graphics.** The payload contains Sixel image data to be rendered on the screen. The parser correctly handles raster attributes, color selection, repeats, and positioning. Requires VT320+ mode. |
| `DCS GATE... ST`| `GATEWAY` | **Gateway Protocol.** Allows the host to communicate with the embedding application. Format: `DCS GATE <Class>;<ID>;<Command>[;<Params>] ST`. |

### 3.6. Other Escape Sequences

This table covers common non-CSI escape sequences.

| Sequence | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ESC c` | `RIS` | **Hard Reset.** Resets the terminal to its initial power-on state, including clearing all graphics resources. |
| `ESC =` | `DECKPAM` | **Keypad Application Mode.** Sets the numeric keypad to send application-specific sequences. |
| `ESC >` | `DECKPNM` | **Keypad Numeric Mode.** Sets the numeric keypad to send numeric characters. |
| `ESC (` C | `SCS` | **Select G0 Character Set.** Designates character set `C` (e.g., `B` for ASCII, `0` for DEC Special Graphics) to the G0 slot. |
| `ESC )` C | `SCS` | **Select G1 Character Set.** Designates a character set to the G1 slot. |
| `ESC *` C | `SCS` | **Select G2 Character Set.** Designates a character set to the G2 slot. |
| `ESC +` C | `SCS` | **Select G3 Character Set.** Designates a character set to the G3 slot. |

### 3.7. VT52 Mode Sequences

When the terminal is in VT52 mode (`KTerm_SetLevel(VT_LEVEL_52)` or by sending `ESC <`), it uses a different, simpler set of non-ANSI commands.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ESC A` | **Cursor Up.** Moves cursor up one line. |
| `ESC B` | **Cursor Down.** Moves cursor down one line. |
| `ESC C` | **Cursor Right.** Moves cursor right one column. |
| `ESC D` | **Cursor Left.** Moves cursor left one column. |
| `ESC H` | **Cursor Home.** Moves cursor to row 0, column 0. |
| `ESC Y r c`| **Direct Cursor Address.** Moves the cursor to the specified row and column. `r` and `c` are single characters with a value of `32 + coordinate`. |
| `ESC I` | **Reverse Line Feed.** Moves the cursor up one line, scrolling the screen down if at the top margin. |
| `ESC J` | **Erase to End of Screen.** Clears from the cursor to the end of the display. |
| `ESC K` | **Erase to End of Line.** Clears from the cursor to the end of the current line. |
| `ESC Z` | **Identify.** The terminal responds with its VT52 identifier: `ESC / Z`. |

## 4. Key Features In-Depth

### 4.1. Color Support

The library supports three color modes, selected via SGR sequences:

1.  **ANSI 16-color:** SGR codes `30-37`, `40-47`, `90-97`, `100-107`. The exact appearance is determined by the `ansi_colors` array.
2.  **256-color:** `CSI 38;5;Pn m` (foreground) and `CSI 48;5;Pn m` (background). The 256-color palette is a standard xterm palette.
3.  **True Color (24-bit):** `CSI 38;2;R;G;B m` (foreground) and `CSI 48;2;R;G;B m` (background).

### 4.2. Mouse Tracking

Mouse tracking must be enabled by the host application sending the appropriate CSI sequence. When enabled, mouse events are translated into byte sequences and sent to the host via the `ResponseCallback`.

-   **Modes:**
    -   `X10`: Basic button press reporting.
    -   `VT200`: Reports on both button press and release.
    -   `Button-Event`: Reports press, release, and motion while a button is held.
    -   `Any-Event`: Reports all mouse events, including motion.
    -   `SGR`: A modern, more robust protocol that supports higher-resolution coordinates and more modifier keys.
-   **Enabling:** Use `CSI ?{mode} h` (e.g., `CSI ?1003 h` for Any-Event tracking).
-   **Focus Reporting:** `CSI ?1004 h` enables reporting of window focus gain/loss events (`CSI I` and `CSI O`).

### 4.3. Character Sets

The terminal supports multiple character sets (G0-G3) and can map them to the active GL (left) and GR (right) slots.

-   **`ESC ( C`**: Designates character set `C` to G0.
-   **`ESC ) C`**: Designates character set `C` to G1.
-   **`SO` (`^N`) / `SI` (`^O`)**: Switch between G0 and G1 for the active GL set.
-   **Supported Sets (`C`):**
    -   `B`: US ASCII (Default)
    -   `A`: UK National
    -   `0`: DEC Special Graphics & Line Drawing
    -   `<`: DEC Multinational Character Set (MCS)

### 4.4. Screen and Buffer Management

-   **Alternate Screen Buffer:** Enabled with `CSI ?1049 h`. This saves the current screen state, clears the screen, and switches to a new buffer. `CSI ?1049 l` restores the original screen. This is commonly used by full-screen applications like `vim` or `less`.
-   **Scrolling Region:** `CSI Pt;Pb r` confines scrolling operations to the lines between `Pt` and `Pb`.
-   **Margins:** `CSI ? Pl;Pr s` confines the cursor to the columns between `Pl` and `Pr`. Requires Mode 69 (`DECLRMM`).

### 4.5. Sixel Graphics

Sixel is a bitmap graphics format designed for terminals, allowing for the display of raster images directly in the character grid. The library provides robust support for parsing and rendering Sixel data, enabling applications to display complex images and figures.

-   **Sequence:** The Sixel data stream is initiated with a Device Control String (DCS) sequence, typically of the form `DCS P1;P2;P3 q <sixel_data> ST`. The parameters `P1`, `P2`, and `P3` control aspects like the background color policy and horizontal grid size. The sequence is terminated by the String Terminator (`ST`).
-   **Enabling:** VT340+ recommended, available from `VT_LEVEL_320` in this library (including `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`).
-   **Functionality:** The internal Sixel parser (`KTerm_ProcessSixelChar`) processes the data stream character by character. It correctly interprets:
    -   **Raster Attributes (`"`)**: To define image geometry.
    -   **Color Introducers (`#`)**: To select from the active 256-color palette. Note: Mode `?1070` can be used to enable a private palette for Sixel/ReGIS.
    -   **Repeat Introducers (`!`)**: To efficiently encode runs of identical sixel data.
    -   **Carriage Return (`$`) and New Line (`-`)**: For positioning the sixel "cursor".
    -   **Sixel Data Characters (`?`-`~`)**: Each character encodes a 6-pixel vertical strip.
-   **Scrolling:** Controlled by `DECSDM` (Mode 80). If enabled (`?80h`), images that exceed the bottom margin are discarded (no scroll). If disabled (`?80l`), the screen scrolls to accommodate the image.
-   **Cursor Placement:** Controlled by Mode 8452. If enabled, the cursor is placed at the end of the graphic. If disabled (default), it moves to the next line.
-   **Rendering:** The parsed Sixel data is written into a pixel buffer (`terminal.sixel.data`). This buffer is uploaded to a GPU texture (`sixel_texture`) and composited over the text grid by the compute shader.
-   **Termination:** The Sixel parser correctly handles the `ST` (`ESC \`) sequence to terminate the Sixel data stream and return to the normal parsing state.

### 4.6. Bracketed Paste Mode

-   **Sequence:** `CSI ?2004 h`
-   **Functionality:** When enabled, pasted text is bracketed by `CSI 200~` and `CSI 201~`. This allows the host application to distinguish between typed and pasted text, preventing accidental execution of commands within the pasted content.

### 4.7. Macros and Automation

**v2.3.10** adds support for terminal macros, allowing the host to define and replay sequences of input.

-   **Define Macro (DECDMAC):** `DCS Pid ; Pst ; Penc ! z <content> ST`
    -   `Pid`: Macro ID.
    -   `Pst`: Storage location (0=Volatile, 1=Non-volatile). KTerm currently stores all macros in session memory (volatile).
    -   `Penc`: Encoding (0=Text, 1=Hex Pairs).
    -   `content`: The sequence to be stored.
    -   **Response:** `DCS > Pid ; Status ST` (0=Success, 1=Storage Full, 2=Error).
-   **Invoke Macro (DECINVM):** `CSI Pid * z`
    -   Replays the content of the macro with ID `Pid` into the input pipeline.
-   **Refresh Rate (DECSRFR):** `CSI Ps " t`
    -   Accepted as a no-op to support legacy VT510 software that requests refresh rate changes.

### 4.8. Session Management

v2.2 implements a true tiling multiplexer, moving beyond simple split-screen.

-   **Independent State:** Each session maintains its own screen buffer (with scrollback), cursor, modes, input pipeline, and parser state.
-   **Panes:** Sessions are displayed in "Panes". The screen is divided into non-overlapping rectangles using a recursive `KTermPane` tree structure. Splits can be Horizontal or Vertical.
    -   **API:** `KTerm_SplitPane(target, type, ratio)` allows dynamic subdivision of the screen.
-   **Focus:** Input is directed to the `focused_pane`.
    -   **API:** `KTerm_SetActiveSession(index)` or modifying `term->focused_pane` changes focus.
    -   **Cursor:** Only the focused pane renders the active hardware cursor. Other panes may show a hollow "inactive" cursor.
-   **Reflow:** When a pane is resized, the session within it automatically reflows its text buffer to fit the new dimensions, preserving as much scrollback history as possible (trimming excess from the top).
-   **Background Processing:** All sessions, visible or not, continue to process data from their input pipelines, update timers, and manage state in the background.
-   **Keybindings:** The multiplexer features an input interceptor (Prefix: `Ctrl+B`):
    -   `%`: Split vertically (Left/Right).
    -   `"`: Split horizontally (Top/Bottom).
    -   `o` / `n`: Cycle focus to the next pane.
    -   `x`: Close current pane (Planned).
-   **VT520 Compatibility:** The multiplexer still honors legacy VT520 commands like `DECSN` (Select Session) and `DECSSDT` (Split Definition) by mapping them to the new layout engine.

### 4.9. I/O Architecture Principle

The terminal operates on a strict **Single I/O Path** principle to ensure security and predictability.

1.  **Single Input Path:** The emulation engine is fed exclusively through the `Input Pipeline` via `KTerm_WriteChar`. Even local echo is typically handled by the host echoing characters back into this pipeline.
2.  **Single Output Path:** All communication to the host—whether it is user input (keystrokes) or device reports (DA/DSR)—is aggregated into the `Response Queue` and delivered via the single `ResponseCallback`.
3.  **Input Transformation:** Physical hardware events are intercepted by the Adapter, immediately transformed into standard Escape Sequences, and routed to the Output Path. They do not directly manipulate the emulation state.

### 4.10. Retro Visual Effects

To mimic the look of classic CRT terminals, the rendering engine includes configurable visual effects:

-   **Curvature:** `terminal.visual_effects.curvature` controls the barrel distortion of the screen.
-   **Scanlines:** `terminal.visual_effects.scanline_intensity` adds horizontal scanline darkening patterns.
-   These are applied in the Compute Shader (`TERMINAL_COMPUTE_SHADER_SRC`) during the final composition step.

### 4.11. ReGIS Graphics

ReGIS (Remote Graphics Instruction Set) is a vector graphics protocol used by DEC terminals. `kterm.h` provides a complete implementation of ReGIS, allowing host applications to draw complex shapes, lines, and text using a specialized command language.

-   **Sequence:** ReGIS commands are encapsulated in a DCS sequence: `DCS p ... ST` (or `ESC P p ... ESC \`).
-   **Supported Commands:**
    -   `P`: **Position**. Moves the graphics cursor.
    -   `V`: **Vector**. Draws lines.
    -   `C`: **Curve**. Draws circles, arcs, and interpolated B-splines.
    -   `T`: **Text**. Draws text strings with configurable size and rotation.
    -   `W`: **Write Control**. Sets writing modes (overlay, replace, erase, complement/XOR) and foreground color.
    -   `S`: **Screen Control**. Clears the screen.
    -   `L`: **Load Alphabet**. Defines custom character patterns for ReGIS text.
    -   `@`: **Macrographs**. Defines and executes macros (sequences of ReGIS commands).
    -   `F`: **Polygon Fill**. Fills arbitrary shapes.
-   **Architecture:** ReGIS rendering is handled by a dedicated "Vector Engine" compute shader. Vector instructions are accumulated into a buffer and rendered as an overlay on top of the text layer.
-   **Enabling:** Enabled for `VT_LEVEL_340`, `VT_LEVEL_525`, and `VT_LEVEL_XTERM`.

### 4.12. Gateway Protocol

The Gateway Protocol is a custom mechanism allowing the host system (e.g., a shell script or backend service) to send structured commands to the application embedding `kterm.h`. This is useful for integrating the terminal with external UI elements, resource managers, or custom hardware.

> **Note:** As of v2.3.1, the Gateway Protocol logic resides in `kt_gateway.h`. It is enabled by default but can be disabled by defining `KTERM_DISABLE_GATEWAY` before including `kterm.h` to reduce binary size.

-   **Sequence:** `DCS GATE <Class> ; <ID> ; <Command> [ ; <Params> ] ST`
-   **Mechanism:** When the terminal parses this sequence, it invokes the user-registered `GatewayCallback`.
-   **Parsing:** The payload is tokenized by semicolons.
    -   `Class`: Category of the command (e.g., "UI", "AUDIO", "MAT").
    -   `ID`: Target object identifier.
    -   `Command`: The action to perform (e.g., "play", "set"). Commands are **case-insensitive** and normalized to lowercase.
    -   `Params`: Optional parameters for the command.
-   **Example:** `\033PGATE;AUDIO;BGM;play;TRACK1\033\` might tell a game engine to play a music track.

**Internal Commands (KTERM Class):**
The class ID `KTERM` is reserved for internal configuration.

#### Gateway Extensions (v2.4.18+)

Introduced in **v2.4.18**, Gateway Extensions provide a modular way to extend the terminal's capabilities without modifying the core library. This system allows the host application to register custom handlers for `EXT` commands sent via the Gateway Protocol.

*   **Command:** `DCS GATE KTERM ; <ID> ; ext ; <Name> ; <Args> ST`
*   **Registration API:** `KTerm_RegisterGatewayExtension(KTerm* term, const char* name, GatewayExtHandler handler);`
*   **Built-in Extensions:**
    *   **`broadcast`**: Sends input characters to all active sessions. Usage: `ext;broadcast;Hello`
    *   **`themes`**: Sets terminal colors. Usage: `ext;themes;set;bg=#RRGGBB`
    *   **`icat`**: Injects an image using the Kitty Graphics Protocol (basic wrapper). Usage: `ext;icat;<Base64Data>`
    *   **`clipboard`**: A placeholder for clipboard integration.
    *   **`direct`**: Toggles Direct Input mode (Local Editing). Usage: `ext;direct;1` (On) or `ext;direct;0` (Off).
    *   **`rawdump`**: Mirrors raw input bytes to a target session. Usage: `ext;rawdump;start;session=n`.
    *   **`automate`**: Manages automation triggers. Usage: `ext;automate;trigger;add;pat;act`.
    *   **`voip`**: Controls the VoIP subsystem (SIP/RTP). Usage: `ext;voip;dial;user@host`.

    *   **`ssh`**: Alias for `net` extension.
    *   **`voice`**: Controls the Voice Reactor subsystem. Usage: `ext;voice;enable;1`.
    *   **`grid`**: (v2.4.21+) Bulk screen manipulation extension. See section 4.12.1 for details.

#### 4.12.1. Gateway Grid Extension (v2.4.21+)

The **grid** extension provides high-performance primitives for bulk manipulation of the terminal screen buffer. It allows host applications to paint regions with specific characters, colors, and attributes without sending large volumes of text.

**Base Command:** `DCS GATE KTERM ; <ID> ; ext ; grid ; <Subcommand> ; <SessionID> ; <Params...> ST`

*   **SessionID:** The target session index (0-3). Use active session if set to `-1` or if omitted in some contexts (though explicit ID is recommended).

**Subcommands:**

1.  **`banner` (Large Text Banner) - v2.4.23**
    *   **Syntax:** `banner ; <sid> ; <x> ; <y> ; <text> ; <scale> ; <mask> ; <ch> ; <fg> ; <bg> ; <ul> ; <st> ; <flags> [; <opts...>]`
    *   **Description:** Plots a large, scaled text banner directly onto the grid using the built-in 8x8 bitmap font. This bypasses VT parsing for high-performance dashboard or overlay construction.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `x, y`: Anchor coordinate (Top-Left of the first character, adjusted by alignment).
        *   `text`: The string to render. Supports `\n` for newlines.
        *   `scale`: Integer scaling factor (e.g., `2` makes 8x8 glyphs into 16x16 blocks).
        *   `mask`: Bitmask indicating which properties to update (usually `1` for char, or `1|2` for char+color).
        *   `ch`: The character used to "paint" the bits (e.g., `#` or `█`).
        *   `fg, bg...`: Styling for the painted cells.
        *   `opts`: Semicolon-separated options.
            *   `align=left` (Default): Text starts at `x`.
            *   `align=center`: Each line is centered horizontally around `x`.
            *   `align=right`: Each line ends at `x`.
            *   `kern=1`: Enables intelligent kerning (proportional spacing) for the built-in font, reducing gaps between characters.

2.  **`fill` (Rectangular Fill)**
    *   **Syntax:** `fill ; <sid> ; <x> ; <y> ; <w> ; <h> ; <mask> ; <ch> ; <fg> ; <bg> ; <ul> ; <st> ; <flags>`
    *   **Description:** Fills a rectangular region defined by `x,y,w,h` with the specified character and attributes.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `x, y`: Top-left coordinate (0-based).
        *   `w, h`: Width and Height.
        *   `mask`: Bitmask indicating which properties to update (see below).
        *   `ch`: Unicode codepoint (decimal).
        *   `fg, bg, ul, st`: Colors for Foreground, Background, Underline, Strikethrough. Format: `rgb:R/G/B`, `pal:Index`, `def` (default).
        *   `flags`: Integer bitmask OR string of pipe-separated attribute names (e.g., `BOLD|PROTECTED`).
            *   Supported names: `BOLD`, `DIM` (or `FAINT`), `ITALIC`, `UNDERLINE`, `BLINK`, `REVERSE` (or `INVERSE`), `HIDDEN` (or `CONCEAL`), `STRIKE`, `PROTECTED`.
            *   Passing `0` or an empty string clears the flags if masking bit 32 is set.

3.  **`stream` (Streamed Packed Data) - v2.4.27**
    *   **Syntax:** `stream ; <sid> ; <x> ; <y> ; <w> ; <h> ; <mask> ; <count> ; <compress> ; <data_base64>`
    *   **Description:** Efficiently updates a large number of cells with varying content via a packed binary stream. Flushes pending ops to ensure concurrency safety.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `x, y`: Start coordinate (Top-Left).
        *   `w, h`: Rect dimensions. Used for wrapping (row-major order).

4.  **`copy` / `move` (Rectangular Copy) - v2.4.27**
    *   **Syntax:** `copy ; <sid> ; <sx> ; <sy> ; <dx> ; <dy> ; <w> ; <h> ; <mode>`
    *   **Syntax:** `move ; <sid> ; <sx> ; <sy> ; <dx> ; <dy> ; <w> ; <h> ; <mode>`
    *   **Description:** Copies or moves a rectangular block of cells from source `(sx,sy)` to destination `(dx,dy)`. `move` automatically clears the source rectangle after copying.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `sx, sy`: Source Top-Left.
        *   `dx, dy`: Destination Top-Left.
        *   `w, h`: Dimensions.

    *   **Description:** Fills a circle centered at `cx,cy` with `radius` using the integer midpoint algorithm.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `cx, cy`: Center coordinate (0-based).
        *   `radius`: Radius in cells.

6.  **`fill_line` (Linear Span) - v2.4.22**
    *   **Syntax:** `fill_line ; <sid> ; <sx> ; <sy> ; <dir> ; <len> ; <mask> ; <ch> ; <fg> ; <bg> ; <ul> ; <st> ; <flags> [; <wrap>]`
    *   **Description:** Fills a linear span of `len` cells starting at `sx,sy` in direction `dir`.
    *   **Parameters:**
        *   `sx, sy`: Start coordinate.
        *   `dir`: Direction char: `h` (Horizontal Right), `v` (Vertical Down), `l` (Left), `u` (Up). Numeric aliases: `0`=h, `1`=v, `2`=l, `3`=u.
        *   `len`: Length in cells.
        *   `wrap`: (Optional) `1` to wrap to the next line (for horizontal fills), `0` to clip at edge.

**Mask Bits (Decimal/Hex):**
The `mask` parameter determines which fields are actually applied to the grid.
*   `1` (0x01): Character (`ch`)
*   `2` (0x02): Foreground Color (`fg`)
*   `4` (0x04): Background Color (`bg`)
*   `8` (0x08): Underline Color (`ul`)
*   `16` (0x10): Strikethrough Color (`st`)
*   `32` (0x20): Attribute Flags (`flags`)

**Optional Parameters & Defaults:**
All style parameters (`ch`, `fg`, `bg`, `ul`, `st`, `flags`) are optional in the syntax.
*   If a parameter is omitted (e.g., `;;` empty field) but its bit is set in the `mask`, the current session's default value for that attribute is used.
*   If a parameter is omitted and its bit is *not* set in the `mask`, it is ignored (grid cell value preserved).
*   If `mask` is `0` (or omitted), the command is treated as a no-op to prevent accidental overwrites.

**Relative & Signed Coordinates (v2.4.26+):**
Grid operations support relative and signed coordinates for flexible positioning.
*   **Relative Offset:** Prefixing a coordinate with `+` or `-` makes it relative to the current cursor position.
    *   `x=+5`: 5 cells to the right of the cursor.
    *   `y=-2`: 2 cells above the cursor.
*   **Negative Dimensions:** Passing a negative value for width (`w`), height (`h`), radius (`r`), or length (`len`) reverses the drawing direction (mirroring).
    *   `w=-10`: Draws 10 cells to the left of `x`.
    *   `h=-5`: Draws 5 cells upwards from `y`.
    *   `len=-20`: In `fill_line`, reverses the direction logic (e.g., Right becomes Left).
*   **Strict Mode:** If `strict_mode` is enabled in `KTermConfig`, absolute negative coordinates are clamped to 0. Explicit relative coordinates (`-5`) remain valid.

**Safe Plotting (Out-of-Bounds):**
All grid operations are safe against out-of-bounds coordinates.
*   **Ignore:** Plots that fall completely outside the terminal grid (negative coordinates or beyond width/height) are silently ignored. No error is generated.
*   **Clipping:** Shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) that partially intersect the visible area are automatically clipped. Only the visible portion is drawn.
*   **Response:** The Gateway `OK;QUEUED;<Count>` response reports the number of *actual* cells modified (in-bounds), allowing the host to detect if a shape was clipped or fully off-screen.

**Stencil Mode (Overlay):**
If the `mask` excludes the Character bit (`1` / `0x01`), the command acts as a stencil overlay.
*   **Banner:** Applies the specified colors/attributes only to the cells where the text pattern is solid, preserving the existing characters on the grid.
*   **Fill/Shapes:** Updates the colors/attributes of the region without changing the text content.

**Protection Override:**
Gateway Grid commands bypass the `PROTECTED` attribute (DECSCA). This enables powerful "Form Design" workflows:
1.  **Fill Background:** Fill the entire screen with `PROTECTED` attribute and a background color.
2.  **Carve Fields:** Use stencil mode (masking out `PROTECTED`) to clear specific regions for user input.

**Example:**
To fill a 10x10 red square with 'X' at (5,5) on Session 0:
`DCS GATE KTERM;0;ext;grid;fill;0;5;5;10;10;7;88;pal:1;pal:0;0;0;0 ST`
(Mask 7 = 1+2+4 -> Char + FG + BG).

**Example: Form Design:**
1. Fill screen with Blue Protected background:
   `fill;0;0;0;80;24;36;;;rgb:0000AA;;;PROTECTED` (Mask 36 = BG+Flags)
2. Carve out White Unprotected input field:
   `fill;0;10;5;20;1;36;;;rgb:FFFFFF;;;0` (Flags=0 clears protected)

### 4.13. RAWDUMP (Raw Input Mirroring)

Introduced in **v2.4.20**, the **RAWDUMP** Gateway extension allows the terminal to mirror incoming raw input bytes from the host (or PTY) to a specific target session's grid as literal single-byte characters. This bypasses the standard VT parser for the target session, allowing for the visualization of control codes and escape sequences exactly as they are received.

*   **Command:** `DCS GATE KTERM ; <ID> ; RAWDUMP ; <Params> ST`
*   **Parameters (Semicolon Separated):**
    *   `START`: Enables mirroring.
    *   `STOP`: Disables mirroring.
    *   `TOGGLE`: Toggles the state.
    *   `SESSION=<ID>`: Specifies the target session ID (0-3) to receive the raw bytes. If omitted, defaults to the active session.
    *   `FORCE_WOB=<1|0>`: "Force White on Black". If set to 1 (default), the target session is cleared and set to white text on black background when mirroring starts.

**Use Cases:**
*   **Debugging:** Inspecting raw escape sequences sent by a remote host.
*   **Education:** Visualizing the VT stream.
*   **Telemetry:** Logging raw input to a secondary "monitor" session.

**Example:**
To dump the input of Session 0 to Session 1:
```bash
# Send to KTerm (via Session 0)
printf "\033PGATE;KTERM;0;rawdump;START;SESSION=1\033\\"
```

### 4.14. Kitty Protocols (Graphics & Keyboard)

KTerm implements both the visual and input protocols defined by the Kitty terminal emulator, bringing modern capabilities to the emulation engine.

#### 4.14.1. Kitty Graphics Protocol

v2.2 adds full support for the Kitty Graphics Protocol, a modern standard for displaying high-performance raster graphics in the terminal.

-   **Mechanism:** Uses APC sequences: `ESC _ G [key=value;...] <payload> ST`.
-   **Features Supported:**
    -   **Transmission:** `a=t` (Transmit), `a=T` (Transmit & Display), `a=q` (Query), `a=p` (Place). Supports direct (RGB/RGBA) and Base64-encoded payloads.
    -   **Chunking:** Handles chunked transmission (`m=1`) for large images.
    -   **Placement:** Detailed control over `x`, `y` position (relative to cell or window) and `z-index`.
    -   **Z-Ordering:**
        -   `z < 0`: Drawn in the background (behind text). Transparency in the text layer (default background color) allows these to show through.
        -   `z >= 0`: Drawn in the foreground (over text).
    -   **Animation:** Fully supports multi-frame animations (`a=f`) with configurable frame delays (`z` parameter).
    -   **Composition:** Images are composited using a dedicated `texture_blit.comp` compute shader, ensuring correct alpha blending and clipping to the specific split-pane they belong to.
    -   **Memory Safety:** Enforces strict VRAM limits (default 64MB) per session to prevent denial-of-service attacks via graphics spam.
    -   **Delete/Clear:** Supports `a=d` (Delete) command with various actions (e.g., `d=a` for all, `d=i` by ID, `d=p` by placement).

#### 4.14.2. Kitty Keyboard Protocol

**v2.4.5** implements the Kitty Keyboard Protocol, a progressive enhancement to standard VT keyboard handling that solves longstanding ambiguity issues (e.g., distinguishing `Tab` from `Ctrl+I`, or `Enter` from `Ctrl+Enter`).

-   **Mechanism:** Applications enable this mode using CSI sequences. Once active, KTerm reports key events using the `CSI u` format.
-   **Sequences:**
    -   `CSI > flags u`: Push current flags to a stack and set new flags (Enable).
    -   `CSI < u`: Pop flags from the stack (Disable/Restore).
    -   `CSI = flags ; mode u`: Set or modify flags directly.
    -   `CSI ? flags u`: Query support.
-   **Format:** `CSI key ; modifiers u`
    -   `key`: Unicode codepoint or functional key code (from Kitty's Private Use Area).
    -   `modifiers`: Bitmask + 1 (`1=None`, `2=Shift`, `3=Alt`, `4=Alt+Shift`, `5=Ctrl`, ...).
-   **Features:**
    -   **Disambiguation:** Keys like `Tab`, `Escape`, `Enter` are reported distinctly from their control-code equivalents.
    -   **Modifiers:** Shift, Alt, Ctrl, and Super are reported reliably for all keys.
    -   **Release Events:** Can optionally report key release events (if requested via flags).

### 4.15. IBM PC / DOS Compatibility Mode

**v2.2.2** introduces a dedicated emulation mode for running legacy DOS applications (e.g., via DOSEMU or remote connection). This mode is activated by setting the compliance level to `VT_LEVEL_ANSI_SYS` (1003).

*   **ANSI.SYS Emulation:** Implements the behavior of the standard MS-DOS `ANSI.SYS` driver.
    *   **Cursor Save/Restore:** Maps standard ANSI `CSI s` and `CSI u` to Save/Restore Cursor (overriding typical DEC usage).
    *   **Line Wrap:** Enforces "Standard Mode 7" (Line Wrap) by default.
    *   **Device Attributes:** Suppresses DA responses to prevents confusion in non-VT aware apps.
*   **Visual Authenticity:**
    *   **CGA Palette:** Enforces the authentic 16-color IBM CGA palette (e.g., Brown `0xAA5500` instead of Yellow).
    *   **IBM Font:** Automatically switches the terminal font to the internal "IBM" raster font (Code Page 437) for correct box-drawing characters.

### 4.16. Dynamic Font Switching & Glyph Centering

**v2.2.1** introduces a dynamic font management system allowing runtime switching between internal fonts.

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **API:** `KTerm_SetFont(term, "Name")`.
    *   **Gateway Protocol:** `set;FONT;Name`.
    *   **OSC 50:** `ESC ] 50 ; Name ST`.
*   **Centering:** The renderer automatically calculates centering offsets. If a font's glyph data (e.g., 8x8) is smaller than the terminal cell size (e.g., 9x16), the glyph is perfectly centered within the cell.
*   **Supported Fonts:** Includes "DEC" (VT220 8x10), "IBM" (VGA 9x16), and any TrueType font loaded via `KTerm_LoadFont`.

### 4.17. Printer Controller Mode

The library supports the DEC Printer Controller Mode (or Media Copy), allowing the host to send data directly to an attached printer (or callback function) without displaying it on the screen.

*   **Enable:** `CSI 5 i` (Auto Print) or `CSI ? 5 i` (Printer Controller).
*   **Disable:** `CSI 4 i` or `CSI ? 4 i`.
*   **Print Form Feed (Mode 18):** When `DECPFF` (`CSI ? 18 h`) is enabled, a Form Feed character (0x0C) is appended to the data stream after a screen print operation.
*   **Print Extent (Mode 19):** Controls the scope of the `Print Screen` (`CSI i`) command.
    *   `DECPEX` Enabled (`CSI ? 19 h`): Prints the full screen.
    *   `DECPEX` Disabled (`CSI ? 19 l`): Prints only the scrolling region.
*   **Callback:** Data is routed to the user-registered `PrinterCallback`.

### 4.18. Rich Text Attributes (Extended SGR)

KTerm supports extended SGR attributes for advanced text styling, including multiple underline styles and colors.

*   **Underline Styles (SGR 4:x):**
    *   `4:1`: Single Underline
    *   `4:2`: Double Underline
    *   `4:3`: Curly Underline (Wave)
    *   `4:4`: Dotted Underline
    *   `4:5`: Dashed Underline
*   **Attribute Colors (SGR 58/59):**
    *   `58;5;Pn`: Set Underline Color (Indexed)
    *   `58;2;R;G;B`: Set Underline Color (TrueColor)
    *   `59`: Reset Underline Color to Default (Foreground)
*   **Strikethrough Color:** Accessible via the Gateway Protocol or API.

### 4.19. Tektronix 4010/4014 Emulation

KTerm includes full emulation of the Tektronix 4010 and 4014 vector graphics terminals.

*   **Entry:** `CSI ? 38 h` (DECTEK) switches the terminal into Tektronix mode.
*   **Exit:** `ESC \x03` (ETX) or similar mode reset sequences return to ANSI/VT mode.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Alpha Mode:** Text rendering.
    *   **Graph Mode:** Vector drawing logic using High/Low X/Y byte encoding.
    *   **GIN Mode:** Graphic Input (Crosshair cursor) reporting.
    *   **Vector Layer:** Renders to the same vector overlay used by ReGIS, ensuring consistent visual blending.

### 4.20. BiDirectional Text Support (BiDi)

KTerm implements basic BiDirectional text support via the `BDSM` (Bi-Directional Support Mode) private mode `8246`.

*   **Mechanism:** When enabled (`CSI ? 8246 h`), the terminal performs an internal "visual reordering" of text on a per-row basis before rendering.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Detects RTL characters (e.g., Hebrew, Arabic).
    *   Reverses RTL runs for correct display.
    *   Mirrors characters like parenthesis `()` and brackets `[]` within reversed runs.
*   **Limitation:** This is a simplified internal implementation (`BiDiReorderRow`) and does not currently use the full `fribidi` library for complex shaping or implicit paragraph direction handling.

### 4.21. DEC Locator Support

The DEC Locator (Mouse) input model provides an alternative to standard xterm mouse tracking, reporting rectangular coordinates and specific events.

*   **Enable:** `CSI ? 41 h` (`DECELR` - Enable Locator Reporting).
*   **Events:** Controlled by `DECSLE` (`CSI ? Ps {`). Can report button down, button up, or only on request.
*   **Request:** `DECRQLP` (`CSI Ps |`) allows the host to query the current locator position instantly.
*   **Status:** `CSI ? 53 n` reports locator availability.

### 4.22. VT Pipe (Gateway Protocol)

Added in **v2.3.2**, the **VT Pipe** feature allows a host application (or test harness) to inject arbitrary data directly into the terminal's input pipeline via the Gateway Protocol. This is particularly useful for automated testing, where sending raw escape sequences (containing control characters like `ESC`) via standard shell pipes can be brittle or unsafe.

*   **Command:** `DCS GATE KTERM ; <ID> ; PIPE ; VT ; <Encoding> ; <Payload> ST`
*   **Encodings:**
    *   `RAW`: Direct text injection. Not suitable for payloads containing `;` or `ESC`.
    *   `HEX`: Hexadecimal string (e.g., `1B5B33316D` for `ESC [ 3 1 m`). Safe for binary data.
    *   **`B64`**: Base64 encoding. The most efficient safe transport for complex sequences.

**Workflow:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    TestHarness["Test Harness / Host"] -->|"DCS GATE ... pipe;VT;B64;..."| Parser["Gateway Parser"]
    Parser -->|"Decode Base64"| Decoder["KTerm Decoder"]
    Decoder -->|"Raw Bytes (ESC [ ...)"| Pipeline["Input Pipeline"]
    Pipeline -->|"Process Events"| Engine["Terminal Engine"]
    Engine -->|"Update State"| Screen["Screen Buffer"]
```

**Example: Remote Color Change**
To set the text color to Red (`ESC [ 31 m`) safely:
1.  **Encode:** `\x1B[31m` -> Base64 `G1szMW0=`
2.  **Send:** `\033PGATE;KTERM;0;pipe;VT;B64;G1szMW0=\033\`
3.  **Result:** The terminal decodes the payload and executes `ESC [ 31 m` as if it were typed locally.

### 4.23. Networking & SSH

The `kt_net.h` module (fully integrated into `kterm.h` in v2.6.0) provides a lightweight, non-blocking networking abstraction. It enables KTerm instances to connect to remote hosts via TCP (raw sockets) or SSH, seamlessly integrating with the KTerm event loop and Gateway Protocol.

**Features:**
- **Client Mode:** Connect to remote TCP servers or SSH hosts.
- **Server Mode:** Accept incoming connections (`KTerm_Net_Listen`) with optional authentication.
- **Non-Blocking Architecture:** Connection attempts and I/O are fully async to prevent UI freezes.
- **Event-Driven:** Callbacks for connection status (`on_connect`, `on_disconnect`), data reception, and errors.
- **Security Hooks:** Interface (`KTermNetSecurity`) for plugging in TLS/SSL (e.g., OpenSSL) or custom encryption (SSH).
- **Protocol Support:**
    - `KTERM_NET_PROTO_RAW`: Raw byte stream.
    - `KTERM_NET_PROTO_FRAMED`: Binary framing for multiplexing resizing, gateway commands, and data.
    - `KTERM_NET_PROTO_TELNET`: Full Telnet protocol (RFC 854) support with state machine and negotiation callbacks.

#### 4.23.1. Configuration Macros

You can disable networking features at compile time to reduce binary size or enforce security policies:
*   `KTERM_DISABLE_NET`: Disables the entire networking module (`kt_net.h`) and associated Gateway commands.
*   `KTERM_DISABLE_TELNET`: Disables the Telnet protocol logic (state machine and callbacks) while keeping Raw TCP and SSH support active.

#### 4.23.2. Initialization & Event Loop

The networking subsystem is initialized automatically by `KTerm_Init`. However, to handle network I/O, you must ensure your main loop calls `KTerm_Update` (which internally calls `KTerm_Net_Process`):

```c
while (running) {
    // KTerm_Update processes Network I/O, timers, and logic
    KTerm_Update(term);
    // ... Render ...
}
```

To handle network events asynchronously, register callbacks:

```c
void my_connect(KTerm* term, KTermSession* session) {
    printf("Connected!\n");
}

void my_error(KTerm* term, KTermSession* session, const char* msg) {
    printf("Net Error: %s\n", msg);
}

KTermNetCallbacks callbacks = {
    .on_connect = my_connect,
    .on_disconnect = my_disconnect,
    .on_data = NULL, // If NULL, data is automatically written to the terminal
    .on_error = my_error,
    // Optional: Handle Telnet Negotiation
    .on_telnet_command = my_telnet_negotiation,
    // Optional: Handle Telnet Subnegotiation (SB)
    .on_telnet_sb = my_telnet_sb_handler
};

KTerm_Net_SetCallbacks(term, session, callbacks);
```

#### 4.23.3. Client Mode

**Programmatic:**
```c
KTermSession* session = &term->sessions[0];
// Connects asynchronously. 'on_connect' called when ready.
KTerm_Net_Connect(term, session, "192.168.1.50", 23, "user", "password");
```

**Gateway Command:**
```
DCS GATE;KTERM;1;ext;net;connect;192.168.1.50:23 ST
```

**Diagnostics:**
Use `KTerm_Net_GetStatus` to retrieve detailed connection state (Host, Port, Retry Count, Last Error).

#### 4.23.4. Server Mode

KTerm can listen for incoming connections, effectively acting as a terminal server.

```c
// Callback to verify credentials (simple auth)
bool my_auth(KTerm* term, KTermSession* session, const char* user, const char* pass) {
    return (strcmp(user, "admin") == 0 && strcmp(pass, "secret") == 0);
}

KTermNetCallbacks cbs = { .on_connect = my_on_client, .on_auth = my_auth };
KTerm_Net_SetCallbacks(term, session, cbs);

// Start Server on port 2323
KTerm_Net_Listen(term, session, 2323);
```

#### 4.23.5. SSH Reference Client & Custom Security

**Reference Implementation (`ssh_client.c`):**
The `ssh_client.c` example serves as the official reference for a "Bring Your Own Crypto" SSH-2 client. It features a complete RFC 4253 state machine and supports:
*   **Authentication:** Public Key (Probe/Sign) with fallback to Password (RFC 4252).
*   **Transport:** Binary packet framing.
*   **Command Line Arguments:**
    *   `--durable`: Enables auto-reconnection on disconnect.
    *   `--persist`: Saves session state to disk on exit and restores on start.
    *   `--config <file>`: Loads a specific configuration file (default `ssh_config`).
    *   `--term <type>`: Sets the terminal type string (e.g., `xterm-256color`).
*   **Configuration File:**
    *   Directives: `Host`, `HostName`, `User`, `Port`, `Durable`, `Term`.
    *   **Triggers:** `Trigger "pattern" "action"` (v2.6.4+) allows simple automation by scanning incoming text.

**Security Hooks:**
KTerm provides an interface (`KTermNetSecurity`) for plugging in TLS/SSL (e.g., OpenSSL) or custom encryption (SSH).

```c
KTermNetSecurity ssh_sec = {
    .ctx = my_ssh_context,
    .handshake = my_ssh_handshake, // Returns KTERM_SEC_OK, AGAIN, or ERROR
    .read = my_ssh_read,           // Decrypts and handles SSH packets
    .write = my_ssh_write,         // Encrypts and frames data
    .close = my_ssh_close
};
KTerm_Net_SetSecurity(term, session, ssh_sec);
```

#### 4.23.6. Telnet Protocol Support

To enable Telnet support (RFC 854 processing), set the protocol to `KTERM_NET_PROTO_TELNET`. This automatically filters IAC sequences and triggers callbacks for negotiation.

```c
KTerm_Net_SetProtocol(term, session, KTERM_NET_PROTO_TELNET);
```

You can handle negotiation (WILL/WONT/DO/DONT) via the `on_telnet_command` callback. If the callback returns `false` (or is NULL), the library automatically rejects requests (sends DONT/WONT) to ensure compliance.

```c
bool my_telnet_handler(KTerm* term, KTermSession* session, unsigned char cmd, unsigned char opt) {
    if (cmd == KTERM_TELNET_WILL && opt == TELNET_OPT_ECHO) {
        // Accept remote echo
        KTerm_Net_SendTelnetCommand(term, session, KTERM_TELNET_DO, opt);
        return true;
    }
    return false; // Reject everything else
}
```
> **Warning:** Telnet transmits data in plaintext. Use `KTERM_DISABLE_TELNET` to disable this feature in secure environments.

#### 4.23.7. Custom Protocol Framing

The `KTERM_NET_PROTO_FRAMED` mode supports binary multiplexing of data and out-of-band events over a single TCP stream.

```c
KTerm_Net_SetProtocol(term, session, KTERM_NET_PROTO_FRAMED);
```

**Packet Format:** `[TYPE:1][LEN:4 (Big Endian)][PAYLOAD:LEN]`

| Type | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | DATA | Raw terminal I/O bytes |
| `0x02` | RESIZE | `[Width:4][Height:4]` (Big Endian) |
| `0x03` | GATEWAY | Gateway Command String (e.g. `ext;grid;fill...`) |
| `0x04` | ATTACH | `[SessionID:1]` (Routes future traffic to session N) |

#### 4.23.8. Session Routing

Network connections are bound to specific `KTermSession` instances. In a multi-pane layout (multiplexer), you can map different connections to different sessions dynamically.

*   **Gateway:** `DCS GATE;KTERM;1;attach;SESSION=2 ST` directs all subsequent data received on the current connection to Session 2.
*   **API:** `KTerm_Net_SetTargetSession(term, session, target_idx)`.

#### 4.23.9. Gateway Control Commands

Networking can be inspected and controlled via `DCS GATE` commands (Extension `EXT`):

*   `ext;net;help`: Displays a list of available network commands and syntax.
*   `ext;net;connect;<target>`: Initiates a connection. Target: `[user[:pass]@]host[:port]`.
*   `ext;net;disconnect`: Closes the connection.
*   `ext;net;ping;<host>`: Checks system connectivity to a host. Returns command output.
*   `ext;net;myip`: Returns the local public-facing IP address.
*   `ext;net;traceroute;host=...;continuous=1`: Runs an asynchronous traceroute. If `continuous=1` is set, it loops indefinitely (MTR-like).
*   `ext;net;responsetime;host=...`: Measures latency and jitter.
*   `ext;net;dns;host`: Synchronously resolves a hostname to an IP address. Returns `OK;IP=...` or `ERR`.
*   `ext;net;portscan;host=...;ports=...`: Runs an asynchronous TCP port scan on a comma-separated list of ports. Usage: `host=192.168.1.1;ports=22,80,443`. Returns `HOST=...;PORT=...;STATUS=...` for each port.
*   `ext;net;whois;host=...`: Runs an asynchronous WHOIS query. Returns `DATA;...` (sanitized) and `DONE`.
*   `ext;net;speedtest;host=...`: Runs a multi-stream throughput/latency test. Auto-selects server if host is omitted or `host=auto`. `graph=1` enables ASCII visualization.
*   `ext;net;httpprobe;url`: Runs an HTTP timing probe returning DNS, TCP, TTFB, and Transfer metrics. Usage: `ext;net;httpprobe;http://example.com`.
*   `ext;net;packetdiag`: Starts the PacketDiag packet sniffer. Usage: `ext;net;packetdiag;interface=eth0;filter="tcp port 80";snaplen=128`. Real-time packets are rendered in ANSI colors.
*   `ext;net;connections`: Lists active network sessions.
*   `ext;net;cancel_diag`: Stops any active asynchronous network diagnostics (Traceroute, Speedtest, PacketDiag, etc.).
*   `ext;automate;trigger;...`: Manages automation triggers.

**Top-Level Network Diagnostics (v2.6.12+):**
In addition to `ext;net;...`, these diagnostics are available as top-level Gateway commands for easier access:
*   `ping;host;[count;interval;timeout]`: Measures response time (same as `ext;net;responsetime`).
*   `dns;host`: Resolves hostname.
*   `portscan;host;ports;[timeout]`: Scans TCP ports.
*   `whois;host;[query]`: Performs WHOIS lookup.
*   `packetdiag;[interface=x;filter=y...]`: Starts packet capture.
*   `packetdiag_pause`: Pauses packet capture (no data loss in ring buffer, drops new packets).
*   `packetdiag_resume`: Resumes packet capture.
*   `packetdiag_filter;expr`: Updates the BPF filter string on the fly.
*   `packetdiag_detail;packet=N`: Returns a detailed Hex/ASCII dump of the Nth packet (relative to capture session).
*   `packetdiag_stop`: Stops packet capture.
*   `packetdiag_status`: Returns capture statistics (Captured Count, Paused State).
*   `ext;ssh;...`: Alias for `ext;net`.

**Speedtest Client (v2.6.18):**
The `speedtest_client` example demonstrates a full network diagnostic application:
*   **Auto-Server List:** Fetches server list via HTTP from `c.speedtest.net` and auto-selects a target.
*   **Jitter Graph:** Visualizes latency variance using a text-based bar chart of sequential probes.
*   **Throughput:** Multi-stream (x4) download and upload testing.

#### 4.23.10. Standalone Networking API (kt_net.h)

While Gateway commands provide easy access, `kt_net.h` offers a rich C API for deeper integration without relying on escape sequences.

*   `KTerm_Net_Init(term)`: Initializes the network subsystem.
*   `KTerm_Net_Connect(term, session, host, port, user, pass)`: Initiates an asynchronous connection.
*   `KTerm_Net_Resolve(host, output_ip, max_len)`: Synchronously resolves a hostname to an IP address string.
*   `KTerm_Net_PortScan(term, session, host, ports, timeout, cb, user_data)`: Initiates an asynchronous TCP port scan.
*   `KTerm_Net_Whois(term, session, host, query, cb, user_data)`: Initiates an asynchronous WHOIS query.
*   `KTerm_Net_HttpProbe(term, session, url, cb, user_data)`: Initiates an asynchronous HTTP timing probe (DNS/TCP/TTFB/DL).
*   `KTerm_Net_SetAutoReconnect(term, session, enable, max_retries, delay_ms)`: Configures automatic connection retry logic for transient errors (e.g., resolving failures).
*   `KTerm_Net_SetCallbacks(term, session, callbacks)`: Registers hooks for data reception (`on_data`), connection state changes (`on_connect`, `on_disconnect`), and error reporting (`on_error`).
*   `KTerm_Net_SetSecurity(term, session, security)`: Plugs in custom cryptographic providers (TLS/SSH) via function pointers.
*   `KTerm_Net_SetProtocol(term, session, proto)`: Selects the active protocol mode: `KTERM_NET_PROTO_RAW` (TCP), `KTERM_NET_PROTO_FRAMED` (Binary Packet), or `KTERM_NET_PROTO_TELNET` (RFC 854).

### 4.24. Session Persistence

KTerm v2.6.1 introduces `kt_serialize.h`, a header-only library for persisting and restoring `KTermSession` state. This enables "Durable" sessions that survive application restarts.

*   **Header:** `kt_serialize.h` (Must define `KTERM_SERIALIZE_IMPLEMENTATION` in one source file).
*   **Format:** Custom binary format with "KTERM_SES_V1" header.
*   **Data Saved:**
    *   Screen Buffer (Text, Colors, Attributes)
    *   Alternate Buffer
    *   Cursor Position
    *   Scrolling Region
    *   View Offset / Scrollback
*   **API:**
    *   `bool KTerm_SerializeSession(KTermSession* session, void** out_buf, size_t* out_len);`
    *   `bool KTerm_DeserializeSession(KTermSession* session, const void* buf, size_t len);`

### 4.25. Voice Reactor (VOIP)

**v2.6.28** introduces "Voice Reactor", a low-latency, lock-free audio subsystem designed to turn K-Term into a collaborative voice command center. It integrates real-time voice communication directly into the terminal session.

*   **Architecture:** The "Voice Reactor" treats the multi-session multiplexer as a studio patchbay. Audio is captured, packetized, and routed between sessions or over the network using `kt_net.h`.
*   **Protocol:** Uses dedicated packet types in the framed protocol:
    *   `KTERM_PKT_AUDIO_VOICE` (0x10): Raw PCM float or Opus voice data.
    *   `KTERM_PKT_AUDIO_COMMAND` (0x11): Voice command payloads (text injection).
    *   `KTERM_PKT_AUDIO_STREAM` (0x12): High-quality inter-session streaming.
*   **Visual Feedback:** A real-time VU meter is rendered on the right edge of the screen using compute shaders (`terminal.comp`). The meter's intensity and color (Green to Red) are driven by the `voice_energy` metric calculated from the capture buffer.
*   **Integration:** Relies on `kt_voice.h` for lock-free ring buffering (SPSC) and `Situation` audio callbacks. It supports Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to trigger transmission or commands.
*   **Control:** Managed via the Gateway Protocol (`ext;voice`) or the C API.

## 5. API Reference

This section provides a comprehensive reference for the public API of `kterm.h`.

### 5.1. Lifecycle Functions

The lifecycle of a K-Term instance follows a clear pattern: creation, initialization, runtime updates, and cleanup. This section documents all functions involved in managing the terminal's lifecycle.

#### Initialization Phase

When creating a new terminal instance, you must first create the instance, then initialize it.

##### `KTerm_Create()`

**Signature:**
```c
KTerm* KTerm_Create(KTermConfig config);
```

**Description:**
Allocates and initializes a new `KTerm` instance with the specified configuration. This function allocates memory for the terminal emulator and initializes all internal structures.

**Parameters:**
- `config`: A `KTermConfig` struct containing terminal configuration options (width, height, compliance level, callbacks, etc.)

**Return Value:**
Returns a pointer to the newly created `KTerm` instance on success, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.

**Example:**
```c
KTermConfig config = {
    .width = 80,
    .height = 25,
    .level = VT_LEVEL_XTERM
};

KTerm* term = KTerm_Create(config);
if (!term) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create terminal\n");
    return false;
}
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Init()` - Initialize terminal after creation
- `KTerm_Destroy()` - Destroy terminal instance
- `KTermConfig` - Configuration structure

**Notes:**
- This function does NOT initialize the terminal. Call `KTerm_Init()` after creation.
- Multiple instances can coexist independently.

##### `KTerm_Init()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_Init(KTerm* term);
```

**Description:**
Initializes a previously created K-Term instance. This must be called after `KTerm_Create()` and before any other operations.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance to initialize

**Example:**
```c
KTerm* term = KTerm_Create(config);
KTerm_Init(term);
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Create()` - Create terminal instance
- `KTerm_Cleanup()` - Cleanup before destruction

**Notes:**
- Must be called after `KTerm_Create()`.
- Sets up GPU resources and rendering pipeline.
- Called internally by `KTerm_Create()` in most cases.

#### Runtime Phase

Once initialized, the terminal operates in a continuous cycle of updates and rendering.

##### `KTerm_Update()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_Update(KTerm* term);
```

**Description:**
Processes pending events and updates terminal state. This is the main "tick" function for the terminal and should be called once per frame in your main loop. It drives all ongoing processes including input processing, timer updates, and event polling.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance

**Behavior:**
- Processes a batch of characters from the input pipeline
- Updates internal timers for cursor and text blinking
- Polls Situation for keyboard and mouse input and translates them into VT events
- Invokes the `ResponseCallback` if any data is queued to be sent to the host

**Example:**
```c
while (running) {
    KTerm_Update(term);
    KTerm_Draw(term);
    // ... present to screen
}
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Draw()` - Render terminal to screen
- `KTerm_ProcessEvents()` - Process input pipeline manually

**Notes:**
- Safe to call from main thread only.
- Should be called once per frame for optimal performance.

##### `KTerm_Draw()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_Draw(KTerm* term);
```

**Description:**
Renders the terminal state to the GPU. This should be called once per frame after `KTerm_Update()`. It iterates over the screen buffer, drawing each character with its correct attributes, and handles drawing the cursor, Sixel graphics, and visual bell.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance

**Example:**
```c
while (running) {
    KTerm_Update(term);
    KTerm_Draw(term);
    // ... present to screen
}
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Update()` - Update terminal state
- `KTerm_Create()` - Create terminal instance

**Notes:**
- Must be called after `KTerm_Update()`.
- Must be called within a Situation `BeginDrawing()` / `EndDrawing()` block.
- Dispatches compute shaders to GPU.

#### Cleanup Phase

When done with the terminal, you must clean up resources in the correct order.

##### `KTerm_Cleanup()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_Cleanup(KTerm* term);
```

**Description:**
Cleans up terminal resources before destruction. This should be called before `KTerm_Destroy()`.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance

**Example:**
```c
KTerm_Cleanup(term);
KTerm_Destroy(term);
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Destroy()` - Destroy terminal instance
- `KTerm_Init()` - Initialize terminal

**Notes:**
- Must be called before `KTerm_Destroy()`.
- Frees GPU resources and buffers.

##### `KTerm_Destroy()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_Destroy(KTerm* term);
```

**Description:**
Destroys a K-Term instance and frees all associated memory. This should be called after `KTerm_Cleanup()`.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance

**Example:**
```c
KTerm_Cleanup(term);
KTerm_Destroy(term);
term = NULL;
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_Cleanup()` - Cleanup before destruction
- `KTerm_Create()` - Create terminal instance

**Notes:**
- Must be called after `KTerm_Cleanup()`.
- Frees all allocated memory including font texture, programmable keys, and dynamically allocated buffers.

#### Complete Lifecycle Example

```c
// Create
KTermConfig config = {
    .width = 80,
    .height = 25,
    .level = VT_LEVEL_XTERM
};
KTerm* term = KTerm_Create(config);
if (!term) return false;

// Initialize
KTerm_Init(term);

// Runtime loop
while (running) {
    KTerm_Update(term);
    KTerm_Draw(term);
    // ... present to screen
}

// Cleanup
KTerm_Cleanup(term);
KTerm_Destroy(term);
```

### 5.2. Host Input (Pipeline) Management

The input pipeline is the primary mechanism for feeding data into the terminal emulator. This section documents all functions for writing data to the terminal and processing it.

#### Basic Input Methods

The simplest way to send data to the terminal is character-by-character or string-by-string.

##### `KTerm_WriteChar()`

**Signature:**
```c
bool KTerm_WriteChar(KTerm* term, unsigned char ch);
```

**Description:**
Writes a single character to the terminal's input pipeline. This is the most basic input method.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance
- `ch`: The character to write

**Return Value:**
Returns `true` on success, `false` if the pipeline is full.

**Example:**
```c
if (!KTerm_WriteChar(term, 'A')) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Input pipeline full\n");
}
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_WriteString()` - Write a string
- `KTerm_WriteFormat()` - Write formatted string
- `KTerm_PushInput()` - Write raw data

##### `KTerm_WriteString()`

**Signature:**
```c
bool KTerm_WriteString(KTerm* term, const char* str);
```

**Description:**
Writes a null-terminated string to the terminal's input pipeline.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance
- `str`: Null-terminated string to write

**Return Value:**
Returns `true` on success, `false` if the pipeline is full.

### 5.3. Keyboard and Mouse Input

User input from the keyboard and mouse is pushed to the terminal using `KTerm_ProcessEvent()` for typed events, `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()` for translated key events, or platform-specific adapters like `KTermSit_ProcessInput()`. The terminal processes these events, converting them into VT sequences that are sent back to the host application via the `ResponseCallback` or `OutputSink`.

#### Keyboard Input

These functions handle keyboard input processing and event retrieval.

##### `KTerm_GetKey()`

**Signature:**
```c
bool KTerm_GetKey(KTerm* term, KTermKeyEvent* event);
```

**Description:**
Retrieves the next processed keyboard event from the output queue, *removing* it from the buffer. This function is used to intercept user input locally.

**Important:** By default, `KTerm_Update` automatically consumes events from this same queue and sends them to the `ResponseCallback` (or `OutputSink`) to simulate transmission to a host. If you call `KTerm_GetKey` and retrieve an event, it will **not** be sent to the callback during the next update. This allows for local handling of hotkeys or input interception.

To disable auto-processing entirely (for manual polling), set `GET_SESSION(term)->input.auto_process = false`.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance
- `event`: Pointer to a `KTermKeyEvent` struct to receive the event data

**Return Value:**
Returns `true` if an event was retrieved, `false` if the queue is empty.

**Example:**
```c
KTermKeyEvent event;
while (KTerm_GetKey(term, &event)) {
    printf("Key: code=%d, sequence=%s\n", event.key_code, event.sequence);
    // Process the key event
}
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()` - Queue input event
- `KTerm_DefineFunctionKey()` - Program function keys
- `KTermKeyEvent` - Key event structure

**Notes:**
- Events are queued in the order they are received.
- Modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) are included in the event.
- Terminal modes affect how keys are reported (e.g., Application Cursor Keys mode).

#### Mouse Input

These functions handle mouse input processing and event reporting.

##### `KTerm_SetMouseTracking()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_SetMouseTracking(KTerm* term, MouseTrackingMode mode);
```

**Description:**
Explicitly sets the mouse tracking protocol mode. This is usually controlled by the host application via escape sequences, but can be set manually.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance
- `mode`: The mouse tracking mode (e.g., `MOUSE_TRACKING_X10`, `MOUSE_TRACKING_VT200`, `MOUSE_TRACKING_SGR`)

None.

**Example:**
```c
// Enable SGR mouse tracking (modern, unambiguous)
KTerm_SetMouseTracking(term, MOUSE_TRACKING_SGR);
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_ProcessEvent()` - Process mouse events from host/platform adapters
- `MouseTrackingMode` - Mouse tracking mode enum

**Notes:**
- Different modes report mouse events in different formats.

#### Input Event Processing

These functions provide lower-level control over input event processing.

##### `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()`

**Signature:**
```c
void KTerm_QueueInputEvent(KTerm* term, KTermKeyEvent event);
```

**Description:**
Queues a translated key event for processing by the terminal. For typed keyboard, mouse, resize, focus, paste, or byte events, use `KTerm_ProcessEvent()`.

**Parameters:**
- `term`: Pointer to the K-Term instance
- `event`: Key event value to queue

**Return Value:**
None. If the key queue is full, the terminal increments its dropped-event counter.

**Example:**
```c
KTermKeyEvent event = {0};
event.key_code = KTERM_KEY_A;
event.ctrl = true;
KTerm_QueueInputEvent(term, event);
```

**See Also:**
- `KTerm_ProcessEvent()` - Process a single event

| Command | Params | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enable` | `1`/`0` | Enables or disables voice capture/playback for the target session. |
| `target` | `<ip>` | Sets the remote peer IP/ID for voice transmission. |
| `command`| `<text>` | Injects a voice command string into the active session (simulates typing). |
| `mute` | `1`/`0` | Globally mutes/unmutes all voice I/O. |

**Example:** Enable voice on the current session.
```bash
printf "\033PGATE;KTERM;0;ext;voice;enable;1\033\\"
```

#### Internal C API

These functions are available when `KTERM_DISABLE_VOICE` is not defined. They map directly to the Gateway commands.

## 6. Internal Operations and Data Flow

This chapter provides a deeper, narrative look into the internal mechanics of the library, tracing the journey of a single character from its arrival in the input pipeline to its final rendering on the screen.

### 6.1. Stage 1: Ingestion

1.  **Entry Point:** A host application calls `KTerm_WriteString("ESC[31mHello")`.
2.  **Buffering:** Each character of the string (`E`, `S`, `C`, `[`, `3`, `1`, `m`, `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`) is sequentially written into the `input_pipeline`, a large circular byte buffer. The `pipeline_head` index advances with each write.

### 6.2. Stage 2: Consumption and Parsing

1.  **The Tick:** The main `KTerm_Update()` function is called. It determines it has a processing budget to handle, for example, 200 characters.
2.  **Dequeuing:** `KTerm_ProcessEvents()` begins consuming characters from the `pipeline_tail`.
3.  **The State Machine in Action:** `KTerm_ProcessChar()` is called for each character:
    -   **`E`, `S`, `C`:** These are initially processed in the `VT_PARSE_NORMAL` state. Since they are regular printable characters, the terminal would normally just print them. However, the parser is about to hit the `ESC` character.
    -   **`ESC` (`0x1B`):** When `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar()` receives the Escape character, it does not print anything. Instead, it immediately changes the parser's state: `terminal.parse_state = VT_PARSE_ESCAPE;`.
    -   **`[`:** The next character is processed by `KTerm_ProcessEscapeChar()`. It sees `[` and knows this is a Control Sequence Introducer. It changes the state again: `terminal.parse_state = PARSE_CSI;` and clears the `escape_buffer`.
    -   **`3`, `1`, `m`:** Now `KTerm_ProcessCSIChar()` is being called.
        -   The characters `3` and `1` are numeric parameters. They are appended to the `escape_buffer`.
        -   The character `m` is a "final byte" (in the range `0x40`-`0x7E`). This terminates the sequence.
4.  **Execution:**
    -   `KTerm_ProcessCSIChar()` calls `KTerm_ParseCSIParams()` on the `escape_buffer` ("31"). This populates the `escape_params` array with the integer `31`.
    -   It then calls `KTerm_ExecuteCSICommand('m')`.
    -   The command dispatcher for `m` (`ExecuteSGR`) is invoked. `ExecuteSGR` iterates through its parameters. It sees `31`, which corresponds to setting the foreground color to ANSI red.
    -   It updates the *current terminal state* by changing `terminal.current_fg` to represent the color red. It does **not** yet change any character on the screen.
    -   Finally, the parser state is reset to `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`.

### 6.3. Stage 3: Character Processing and Screen Buffer Update

1.  **`H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`:** The parser is now back in `VT_PARSE_NORMAL`. `KTerm_ProcessNormalChar()` is called for each of these characters.
2.  **Placement:** For the character 'H':
    -   The function checks the cursor's current position (`terminal.cursor.x`, `terminal.cursor.y`).
    -   It retrieves the `EnhancedTermChar` struct at that position in the `screen` buffer.
    -   It sets that struct's `ch` field to `'H'`.
    -   Crucially, it copies the *current* terminal attributes into the cell's attributes: `cell->fg_color` gets the value of `terminal.current_fg` (which we just set to red).
    -   The `dirty` flag for this cell is set to `true`.
    -   The cursor's X position is incremented: `terminal.cursor.x++`.
3.  This process repeats for 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', each time placing the character, applying the current SGR attributes (red foreground), and advancing the cursor.

### 6.4. Stage 4: Rendering (Compositor Loop)

1.  **Drawing Frame:** `KTerm_Draw()` is called.
2.  **Texture Blit (Background):** `KTerm_Draw` iterates through visible panes. For each session with `z < 0` Kitty images, it dispatches `texture_blit.comp` to draw them onto the `output_texture`. It sets a clipping rectangle via push constants to ensure images don't bleed into adjacent panes.
3.  **SSBO Update:** `KTerm_UpdateSSBO()` traverses the `layout_root` tree. For every visible cell on screen, it determines which session it belongs to, retrieves the `EnhancedTermChar`, packs it into `GPUCell`, and uploads it to the SSBO.
4.  **Compute Dispatch (Text):** The core `terminal.comp` shader is dispatched. It renders the character grid. Crucially, the "default background" color (index 0) is rendered as transparent (alpha=0), allowing the previously drawn background images to show through.
5.  **Texture Blit (Foreground):** A second pass of `texture_blit.comp` draws Sixel graphics and `z >= 0` Kitty images over the text.
6.  **Presentation:** The final `output_texture` is presented.

This entire cycle leverages the GPU for massive parallelism, ensuring the terminal remains responsive even at high resolutions.

### 6.5. Stage 5: Keyboard Input Processing

Concurrent to the host-to-terminal data flow, the library handles user input from the physical keyboard and mouse, translating it into byte sequences that a host application can understand.

1.  **Event Queueing:** The hosting application (or platform adapter) pushes typed input through `KTerm_ProcessEvent()` or translated key events through `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()`. Key input uses `KTermKeyEvent`, which captures the raw key code and modifier states.
2.  **Translation:** During `KTerm_QueueInputEvent()`, or when `KTerm_ProcessEvent()` receives a key event, the terminal translates these events into VT sequences using `KTerm_TranslateKey()`. This function populates the `sequence` field based on a series of rules:
    -   **Control Keys:** `Ctrl+A` is translated to `0x01`, `Ctrl+[` to `ESC`, etc.
    -   **Application Modes:** It checks the session input state for cursor key mode (DECCKM) and keypad mode (DECKPAM). If these modes are active, it generates application-specific sequences (e.g., `ESC O A` for the up arrow) instead of the default ANSI sequences (`ESC [ A`).
    -   **Meta Key:** If the session input state has `meta_sends_escape` enabled, pressing `Alt` in combination with another key will prefix that key's character with an `ESC` byte.
    -   **Normal Characters:** Standard printable characters are typically encoded as UTF-8.
4.  **Buffering:** The processed `KTermKeyEvent`, now containing the final byte sequence, is placed into `session->input.buffer`, a circular event buffer.
5.  **Host Retrieval (API):** Applications that intercept local input can call `KTerm_GetKey()` in their main loop. This function dequeues the next event from the buffer, providing the host with the translated sequence.
6.  **Host Transmission (Callback):** With `session->input.auto_process` enabled, `KTerm_Update()` automatically drains queued key events and sends their sequences to the `ResponseCallback` or `OutputSink`. For local echo, the same sequence can also be written back into the terminal's *input* pipeline to be displayed on screen.

This clear separation of host input (`input_pipeline`) and user input (`session->input.buffer` -> `ResponseCallback`/`OutputSink`) ensures that the terminal acts as a proper two-way communication device, faithfully translating between user actions and the byte streams expected by terminal-aware applications.

## 7.3. Advanced Usage Patterns

This section provides practical patterns and best practices for advanced K-Term integration.

### 7.3.1. High-Performance Graphics Integration

When integrating Sixel, Kitty, or ReGIS graphics, follow these patterns for optimal performance:

**Pattern: Batch Graphics Updates**
```c
// Instead of sending graphics one at a time, batch them
for (int i = 0; i < image_count; i++) {
    // Prepare image data
    const unsigned char* image_data = get_image(i);
    size_t image_size = get_image_size(i);
    
    // Send to terminal
    KTerm_PushInput(term, image_data, image_size);
}

// Process all at once
KTerm_Update(term);
```

**Pattern: Monitor VRAM Usage**
```c
// Check graphics memory usage
KTermStatus status = KTerm_GetStatus(term);
if (status.graphics_vram_used > VRAM_THRESHOLD) {
    // Clear old graphics or reduce quality
    KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, "REset;GRAPHICS");
}
```

### 7.3.2. Multi-Session Workflow

For applications using multiple sessions:

**Pattern: Session-Specific Graphics**
```c
// Set graphics target to specific session
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, "set;SIXEL_SESSION;1");

// Send Sixel data - goes to session 1
KTerm_WriteString(term, sixel_data);

// Reset to default
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, "REset;SIXEL_SESSION");
```

**Pattern: Background Session Updates**
```c
// Update session 1 while session 0 is active
for (int i = 0; i < data_length; i++) {
    KTerm_WriteCharToSession(term, 1, data[i]);
}

// Session 1 updates in background
KTerm_Update(term);
```

### 7.3.3. Performance Optimization

**Pattern: Adaptive Frame Rate**
```c
// Measure frame time
double frame_start = get_time_ms();

KTerm_Update(term);
KTerm_Draw(term);

double frame_time = get_time_ms() - frame_start;

// Adjust processing budget if needed
if (frame_time > TARGET_FRAME_TIME) {
    KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 1.0f);  // Reduce budget
} else if (frame_time < TARGET_FRAME_TIME * 0.5) {
    KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 3.0f);  // Increase budget
}
```

**Pattern: Overflow Detection and Handling**
```c
// Check for pipeline overflow
if (KTerm_IsEventOverflow(term)) {
    // Log warning
    fprintf(stderr, "Input pipeline overflow detected\n");
    
    // Clear pending events to recover
    KTerm_ClearEvents(term);
    
    // Optionally reduce input rate
    usleep(10000);  // 10ms delay
}
```

### 7.3.4. Gateway Protocol Extensions

**Pattern: Custom Extension Handler**
```c
void my_extension_handler(KTerm* term, const char* data) {
    printf("Custom extension received: %s\n", data);
    // Process custom data
}

// Register extension
KTerm_RegisterGatewayExtension(term, "myext", my_extension_handler);

// Host can now send: DCS GATE KTERM;0;ext;myext;data ST
```

**Pattern: Grid-Based Dashboard**
```c
// Fill background with protected cells
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, 
    "ext;grid;fill;0;0;0;80;24;36;;;rgb:0000AA;;;PROTECTED");

// Draw title bar
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;banner;0;0;0;Dashboard;2;7;#;rgb:FFFF00;rgb:0000AA");

// Draw status fields (unprotected for user input)
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;fill;0;10;5;20;1;36;;;rgb:FFFFFF;;;0");
```

## 7.4. Performance Optimization Guide

### 7.4.1. Input Pipeline Tuning

The input pipeline processes characters at a configurable rate to balance responsiveness with CPU usage.

**Recommended Settings:**

| Use Case | Target FPS | Time Budget | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Interactive Terminal | 60 | 2.0ms | Balanced responsiveness and CPU |
| High-Throughput Graphics | 30 | 5.0ms | Prioritize graphics throughput |
| Low-Power Embedded | 30 | 1.0ms | Minimize CPU usage |
| Real-Time Applications | 120 | 1.0ms | Maximum responsiveness |

**Configuration Example:**
```c
// For high-throughput graphics
KTerm_SetPipelineTargetFPS(term, 30);
KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 5.0f);

// For real-time applications
KTerm_SetPipelineTargetFPS(term, 120);
KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 1.0f);
```

### 7.4.2. Memory Optimization

**Buffer Sizing:**
- Input Pipeline: Default 1MB (configurable via `KTERM_INPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE`)
- Output Pipeline: Default 16KB (configurable via `KTERM_OUTPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE`)
- Graphics VRAM: Default 64MB (configurable via `KTermConfig.vram_limit`)

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Reduce Buffer Sizes** for embedded systems
2. **Monitor Overflow** to detect undersized buffers
3. **Clear Graphics** periodically to free VRAM
4. **Use Streaming** for large data transfers

### 7.4.3. Rendering Optimization

**GPU Pipeline Efficiency:**
- Text rendering uses single compute shader pass
- Graphics compositing uses dedicated texture_blit shader
- Dirty flag optimization skips unchanged cells

**Optimization Tips:**
1. **Minimize Screen Updates** - Only update changed regions
2. **Batch Graphics** - Send multiple images in one update
3. **Use Appropriate Levels** - Higher VT levels may have more overhead
4. **Profile Rendering** - Use `KTerm_GetStatus()` to measure performance

### 7.4.4. Thread Safety Considerations

**Safe Operations:**
- `KTerm_WriteChar()` - Thread-safe
- `KTerm_WriteCharToSession()` - Thread-safe
- `KTerm_Update()` - Main thread only
- `KTerm_Draw()` - Render thread only

**Pattern: Multi-Threaded Input**
```c
// Thread 1: Input from network
void network_thread(KTerm* term) {
    while (running) {
        unsigned char ch = read_from_network();
        KTerm_WriteChar(term, ch);  // Thread-safe
    }
}

// Thread 2: Main loop
void main_loop(KTerm* term) {
    while (running) {
        KTerm_Update(term);      // Main thread only
        KTerm_Draw(term);        // Render thread only
        present_to_screen();
    }
}
```

## 8. Configuration Constants

These `#define` constants, located at the top of `kterm.h`, allow for compile-time configuration of the terminal's default behaviors and resource limits. To change them, you must define them *before* the `#include "kterm.h"` line where `KTERM_IMPLEMENTATION` is defined.

| Constant | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DEFAULT_TERM_WIDTH` | `132` | Sets the default width of the terminal screen in character cells. This is the value used on initial startup. |
| `DEFAULT_TERM_HEIGHT`| `50` | Sets the default height of the terminal screen in character cells. |
| `DEFAULT_CHAR_WIDTH` | `8` | The width in pixels of a single character glyph in the bitmap font. This value is tied to the included `font_data.h`. |
| `DEFAULT_CHAR_HEIGHT`| `16` | The height in pixels of a single character glyph. Also tied to the font data. |
| `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SCALE`| `1` | A scaling factor applied to the window size and font rendering. A value of `2` would create a 2x scaled window. |
| `MAX_ESCAPE_PARAMS` | `32` | The maximum number of numeric parameters that can be parsed from a single CSI sequence (e.g., `CSI Pn;Pn;...;Pn m`). Increasing this allows for more complex SGR sequences but uses more memory. |
| `MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER`| `512` | The size of the buffer used to temporarily store incoming escape sequences (CSI, OSC, DCS, etc.) during parsing. If you expect very long OSC title strings or DCS payloads, you may need to increase this. |
| `MAX_TAB_STOPS` | `256` | The maximum number of columns for which tab stops can be set. This should be greater than or equal to `DEFAULT_TERM_WIDTH`. |
| `MAX_TITLE_LENGTH` | `256` | The maximum length of the window and icon titles that can be set via OSC sequences. |
| `KEY_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE`| `65536`| The size of the circular buffer for queuing processed keyboard events before they are sent to the host. A larger buffer can handle rapid typing without dropping events. |
| `KTERM_INPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE` | `1048576`| The size of the input buffer (1MB) used to receive data from the host application. A large buffer is crucial for high-throughput graphics protocols like Sixel and Kitty. |
| `KTERM_OUTPUT_PIPELINE_SIZE` | `16384`| The size of the buffer used to queue responses (keyboard input, mouse events, status reports) to be sent back to the host application via the `ResponseCallback`. |

## 9. Usage Examples and Tutorials

This section provides comprehensive examples and step-by-step tutorials for common K-Term integration scenarios.

### 9.1. Basic Terminal Integration

**Scenario:** Integrate K-Term into a simple application with keyboard and mouse input.

**Step 1: Initialize the Terminal**
```c
#include "kterm.h"

int main() {
    // Create configuration
    KTermConfig config = {
        .width = 80,
        .height = 25,
        .level = VT_LEVEL_XTERM,
        .enable_sixel = true,
        .enable_kitty_graphics = true
    };
    
    // Create terminal instance
    KTerm* term = KTerm_Create(config);
    if (!term) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to create terminal\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Initialize terminal
    if (!KTerm_Init(term)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialize terminal\n");
        KTerm_Destroy(term);
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Step 2: Set Up Callbacks**
```c
// Output callback for responses
void output_callback(void* ctx, const char* data, size_t len) {
    FILE* output = (FILE*)ctx;
    fwrite(data, 1, len, output);
    fflush(output);
}

// Title change callback
void title_callback(KTerm* term, const char* title, bool is_icon) {
    if (!is_icon) {
        printf("Window title: %s\n", title);
    }
}

// In main:
KTerm_SetOutputSink(term, output_callback, stdout);
KTerm_SetTitleCallback(term, title_callback);
```

**Step 3: Main Event Loop**
```c
bool running = true;

while (running) {
    // Update terminal (process input pipeline)
    KTerm_Update(term);
    
    // Render terminal
    KTerm_Draw(term);
    
    // Present to screen
    present_to_display();
    
    // Handle input
    handle_keyboard_input(term);
    handle_mouse_input(term);
    
    // Check for exit condition
    if (should_exit()) {
        running = false;
    }
}

// Cleanup
KTerm_Cleanup(term);
KTerm_Destroy(term);
```

### 9.2. Multi-Session Terminal Multiplexer

**Scenario:** Create a terminal multiplexer with split-screen support.

**Step 1: Initialize Multiple Sessions**
```c
KTerm* term = KTerm_Create(config);
KTerm_Init(term);

// Sessions are automatically initialized
// Access them via KTerm_SetActiveSession()
```

**Step 2: Create Split Layout**
```c
// Split screen vertically (50/50)
KTermPane* right_pane = KTerm_SplitPane(term, NULL, PANE_SPLIT_VERTICAL, 0.5f);

// Split right pane horizontally (60/40)
KTermPane* bottom_pane = KTerm_SplitPane(term, right_pane, PANE_SPLIT_HORIZONTAL, 0.6f);

// Now we have 3 panes with sessions 0, 1, 2
```

**Step 3: Route Input to Active Pane**
```c
// Input automatically goes to focused pane
// Switch focus with Ctrl+B followed by navigation keys
// Or programmatically:
KTerm_SetActiveSession(term, 1);  // Switch to session 1
```

**Step 4: Update All Sessions**
```c
// All sessions update in background
KTerm_Update(term);

// Write to specific session
KTerm_WriteCharToSession(term, 0, 'A');
KTerm_WriteCharToSession(term, 1, 'B');
KTerm_WriteCharToSession(term, 2, 'C');
```

### 9.3. Graphics Integration (Sixel/Kitty)

**Scenario:** Display images using Sixel or Kitty Graphics Protocol.

**Step 1: Prepare Image Data**
```c
// Load image and convert to Sixel format
unsigned char* sixel_data = load_image_as_sixel("image.png");
size_t sixel_size = get_sixel_size();
```

**Step 2: Send to Terminal**
```c
// Method 1: Direct write
KTerm_PushInput(term, sixel_data, sixel_size);

// Method 2: Via Gateway Protocol (for Kitty)
char gateway_cmd[1024];
snprintf(gateway_cmd, sizeof(gateway_cmd),
    "\033PGATE;KTERM;0;ext;icat;%s\033\\",
    base64_encode(image_data));
KTerm_WriteString(term, gateway_cmd);
```

**Step 3: Process and Render**
```c
KTerm_Update(term);
KTerm_Draw(term);
```

### 9.4. Gateway Protocol Dashboard

**Scenario:** Create an interactive dashboard using Gateway Protocol grid operations.

**Step 1: Create Background**
```c
// Fill entire screen with blue background
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;fill;0;0;0;80;24;36;;;rgb:0000AA;;;PROTECTED");
```

**Step 2: Add Title Bar**
```c
// Draw title with yellow text on blue background
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;banner;0;0;0;System Dashboard;2;7;#;rgb:FFFF00;rgb:0000AA");
```

**Step 3: Add Input Fields**
```c
// Create unprotected input field
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;fill;0;10;5;20;1;36;;;rgb:FFFFFF;;;0");

// Add label
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;grid;banner;0;2;5;Input:;1;7;#;rgb:FFFFFF;rgb:0000AA");
```

**Step 4: Update Values**
```c
// Update status line with current values
char status[256];
snprintf(status, sizeof(status),
    "ext;grid;banner;0;2;20;CPU: %d%% MEM: %d%%;1;7;#;rgb:00FF00;rgb:0000AA",
    cpu_usage, mem_usage);
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, status);
```

### 9.5. Remote Terminal Connection

**Scenario:** Connect to a remote host via SSH and display terminal.

**Step 1: Establish Connection**
```c
// Use Gateway Protocol networking
KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term,
    "ext;net;connect;ssh://user@host.com");
```

**Step 2: Handle Connection Events**
```c
void connection_callback(KTerm* term, int status) {
    if (status == CONNECTED) {
        printf("Connected to remote host\n");
    } else if (status == DISCONNECTED) {
        printf("Disconnected from remote host\n");
    }
}

KTerm_SetConnectionCallback(term, connection_callback);
```

**Step 3: Forward Input/Output**
```c
// Input from local keyboard goes to remote
KTerm_WriteString(term, "ls -la\n");

// Output from remote appears in terminal
KTerm_Update(term);
KTerm_Draw(term);
```

### 9.6. Performance Monitoring

**Scenario:** Monitor and optimize terminal performance.

**Step 1: Collect Performance Data**
```c
KTermStatus status = KTerm_GetStatus(term);

printf("Input Pipeline: %d/%d bytes\n",
    status.input_pipeline_used,
    status.input_pipeline_capacity);

printf("Characters Processed: %d\n",
    status.characters_processed);

printf("Overflow Events: %d\n",
    status.overflow_count);

printf("Average Frame Time: %.2f ms\n",
    status.average_frame_time_ms);
```

**Step 2: Detect and Handle Overflow**
```c
if (KTerm_IsEventOverflow(term)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Input pipeline overflow!\n");
    
    // Clear pending events
    KTerm_ClearEvents(term);
    
    // Reduce input rate
    usleep(10000);
    
    // Optionally reduce processing budget
    KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 1.0f);
}
```

**Step 3: Adaptive Tuning**
```c
// Measure frame time
double frame_start = get_time_ms();

KTerm_Update(term);
KTerm_Draw(term);

double frame_time = get_time_ms() - frame_start;

// Adjust if needed
if (frame_time > 16.67) {  // Target 60 FPS
    KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 1.0f);  // Reduce
} else if (frame_time < 8.0) {  // Well under budget
    KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 3.0f);  // Increase
}
```

### 9.7. Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue: Input Pipeline Overflow**
- **Cause:** Host sending data faster than terminal can process
- **Solution:** Increase time budget or reduce input rate
- **Code:**
  ```c
  KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 5.0f);  // Increase from default 2.0ms
  ```

**Issue: Graphics Not Displaying**
- **Cause:** Graphics protocol not enabled or wrong format
- **Solution:** Verify emulation level and graphics format
- **Code:**
  ```c
  KTerm_SetLevel(term, VT_LEVEL_XTERM);  // Ensure graphics support
  ```

**Issue: High CPU Usage**
- **Cause:** Processing too many characters per frame
- **Solution:** Reduce time budget or target FPS
- **Code:**
  ```c
  KTerm_SetPipelineTargetFPS(term, 30);  // Reduce from 60
  KTerm_SetPipelineTimeBudget(term, 1.0f);  // Reduce from 2.0ms
  ```

**Issue: Memory Usage Growing**
- **Cause:** Graphics VRAM not being freed
- **Solution:** Clear graphics periodically
- **Code:**
  ```c
  KTerm_ExecuteGatewayCommand(term, "REset;GRAPHICS");
  ```
